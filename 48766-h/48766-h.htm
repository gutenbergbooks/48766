<h2>THE VILLAGE TEACHER.</h2>


<p>Among the smooth faced urchins
that were subject to my little kingdom
about fifteen years ago, was a
tall awkward boy, named Jonathan
Gull. Jonathan was the son of an honest
hard working farmer, who lived
about two miles from the village, and
who had by dint of frugality, acquired
some property, and with it a proportional
degree of consideration in
the eyes of his neighbours. His crops
of wheat were generally large, and
he made a journey to the metropolis
once a year, to dispose of his grain
and produce. On these occasions his
wife and a grown up daughter would
usually accompany him to see the city
and to buy cheap goods. It did one's
heart good to witness the return of
the honest farmer&mdash;the smile of self-complacency
with which he greeted
the members of his family, and the
eagerness with which he inquired respecting
the farm, Old Roan, and the
young colt, and brindle, the cow, and
the litter of young pigs; and the air
of importance which he assumed towards
his neighbours, who thronged
around him to hear the latest news-what
Boney was doing&mdash;the yellow
fever&mdash;and the price of wheat. His
hearty greeting of his acquaintance;
the animation which sparkled in his
sunburnt face; his short thick set
figure, decked out in a suit of homespun
grey, with large brass buttons;
his arms a kimbo; and the broad
burst of merriment, that, amidst the
discussion of graver subjects, occasionally
broke forth at some sly turn,
or second hand joke of the traveller;
altogether formed the beau ideal of
homely rustic happiness, and prosperity.
Nor was the greeting and
excitation less on the part of the wife
and daughter. As the wagon was
emptied of its load, treasure after
treasure met the eyes of the delighted
group of children and neighbours.
Here were a new set of milk pans,
and a churn for the dairy; a dozen
of pewter spoons, as smooth and as
bright as silver, and scrubbing brushes,
and knives and forks to repair the
waste of years. There glittered lots of
new calico, as fine as red and yellow
could make them; papers of pins
and needles, and all the sundry articles
which complete the stock of
an industrious housewife; while in
another place were cautiously hid,
lest they should excite undue envy,
the silver teaspoons and teapot, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
the bundles of coffee and tea and
white sugar, together with the tortoise
shell combs and gold ear-rings
which the good natured husband had
been importuned to buy. Let not the
reader turn away with contempt from
this simple picture; the event was an
important one in the family of farmer
Gull, and supplied it with a stock,
not only of necessities and luxuries,
but of conversation and pleasure for
a full season. But alas! in the train
of all this prosperity and gladness
marched the forerunners of decay.
Farmer Gull's heavy purse of shining
dollars had won the heart of
many a knight of the counter, and
many were the plans laid to obtain a
a closer intimacy with their owner.
Here Mrs. Gull was invited to sit
down in the parlour to rest herself;
and there was she pressed to stay to
tea. One talked to her about her
butter and her cheese, and another
about her rosy faced children. In
short, it so happened, that in the
course of a few years, she had at
least half a dozen acquaintances in
the shopkeeping line, each of whom
were under engagement to spend a
short time during the Dog-days at
Melrose; for so was the farm now
styled. With these new acquaintances,
new views and expectations
filled the minds of the wife and
daughters. The old family Bible and
the Pilgrim's Progress were less frequently
read and quoted; the calico
short gowns in which they used to
visit their neighbours of a summer
evening gave place to dresses of silk
and white muslin, and their talk was
now of the fashions and the new novels.
Among other changes it was
determined to make a merchant of
Jonathan, and a place was accordingly
engaged for him with the particular
friend of the family, Mr. Seersucker.&mdash;&mdash;I
was struck with the appearance
of the lad when he came
to bid me good bye and take his books
from school. He was dressed in a suit
of tidy homespun, made up by the
hands of his mother and sisters, and
which was, from the sheep that furnished
the wool to the thread with
which the garments were sewed, the
produce of his father's farm. The
good old fashioned notions of domestic
industry were not then extinct.
Our farmers had not then found that
it was cheaper to keep a family of
strapping daughters idle at home, and
send the wool to one factory to be
carded and spun, and to another to be
wove and dyed, and then to a fop of a
tailor to be made up into coats, than to
have the cards, the wheel, and the
loom at their own fire-side; giving
wholesome occupation to their family,
enlivening the gloomy hours of winter,
and cementing by good humour and
mutual assistance the ties of family
and kindred. We had not then found
out the grand modern secret of economy;
that it is better to pamper a
few inordinate manufacturing establishments,
with all their consequences,
of a degraded and dependant population
and high taxes, than to let
every individual pursue his own interests,
and to encourage that best of
domestic manufactures where the
workshop is the kitchen of the farmer,
and his wife and children the
contented and uncorrupted labourers.</p>

<p>But I find myself perpetually digressing
from my story, and must bid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
a truce to these rambling thoughts.
Jonathan, as I was saying, was tidily
dressed; his hair was combed smooth
on his forehead, and hanging long behind,
and the awkwardness of his figure,
was scarcely apparent in the expression
of good health and contentment
that animated him. It soon became
apparent, however, that citizen
Jonathan would not long be contented
with his homely garb. At his first visit
home I observed that he had been
in the hands of a fashionable hair-dresser,
who had given him the true
Bonapartean topknot. His shirt collar
was stretched up till it half covered
his ears and cheeks, and he sported
a clouded and twisted cane, while the
remainder of his dress was yet unchanged.
By degrees the exuvia of
the clown fell off, as I have seen a
snake in the spring slowly emerge
from the shrivelled skin which she
has cast, or as a locust may sometimes
be seen breaking through his
faded coat of mail and sporting in
gaudy robes of green and gold; or as
you may observe in the ponds a kind
of doubtful animal, half frog and half
tadpole. Jonathan became in a year
or two the admiration of all the neighbouring
milk maids, and was universally
accounted a fine gentleman. He
had not be sure ciphered further than
Practice, and was but a dull hand,
when a boy, at Murray's grammar;
but so wonderfully had a city life
sharpened his wits, that his old master
himself was quite in the back ground
when Jonathan was present; he poured
forth such a torrent of words and
discoursed so fluently about politics
and trade and great men. Then came
the days of delusion and speculation.
Jonathan was now of age, and as he
had what was called a good turn for
business, and a strong back to support
him, he was solicited to engage in
trade. A partnership was accordingly
formed, and "GULL, SNIPE,
&amp; Co." glittered in golden capitals
across Market Street. A capital of
some thousands was paid down, while
goods to the amount of hundreds of
thousands were bought and sold.</p>

<p>In the meantime farmer Gull was
floating on the very spring tide of prosperity.
His wealth, which was yearly
increasing, gave him great weight in
the neighbourhood; he was made
overseer of the poor, and there was
a talk of sending him to Congress.
When that ill starred measure which
created at a birth a swarm of banks,
more greedy and more lean than Pharaoh's
kine, was adopted, farmer Gull
partook of the delusion. He was
made a director of the bank of Potosi,
which was located in our village,
and from that moment gave himself
up to dreams of imaginary wealth.
He stocked his farm with merino
sheep, at an average of fifty dollars a
head, and calculated that in six years
he should double his money. Six years
have elapsed, and farmer Gull's whole
flock will not now sell for the cost of a
single ewe. He mortgaged his farm to
the bank, that he might buy a neighbouring
property, and prosecute some
expensive improvements in the way
of mills and factories. At home every
thing was changed. Mistress Gull
rode to church in a handsome carriage,
which Jonathan had sent up
from town; and Polly and Biddy, instead
of being at the milk pail by
sunrise, lay abed till breakfast time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
and then came down with pale and
languid countenances, and their hair
buckled into "kill-beaus" and "heart
breakers," to partake of coffee which
unnerved their system, and rendered
them feverish and nervous till dinner
time. Why should I proceed with
my story? The sequel may be read
in the present circumstances of many
a once thriving family. The lean kine
of Simon devoured his fat kine, and
distress and confusion covered the
face of the country. Gull, Snipe, &amp;
Co., after a few years of fictitious
prosperity, and proportional extravagance,
went the way of half Market
Street. Farmer Gull was their security,
and had to make heavy payments
to the bank. His own speculations
had proved ruinous, the clouds became
continually darker and thicker
around him, and have at length burst
upon his head. His whole property
is insufficient to pay the mortgages,
and his stock and furniture will be
sold next week by the sheriff. Such
is the termination of farmer Gull's
career. His family is incapacitated
for its present destitute situation, and
has lost the inclination and the power
of being frugal: he himself, I observe,
bears his troubles with an
appearance of unusual fortitude. He
preserves his cheerful spirits, and has
become the life of a circle of embarrassed
farmers that frequent a tavern
opposite the window of my study. I
see him there daily&mdash;sometimes to
be sure moody and disconsolate, but
more often leading the chorus of some
Bacchanalian song, or retailing the
merry jests of some quondam acquaintance,
of a lawyer, or bank director.
Alas! for my countrymen;&mdash;when
shall we see again the days of
honest dealing, sturdy frugality, unsophisticated
manners, and household
industry?</p>

<p>It has been said by a writer, whose
genius and scholarship are in the highest
degree honourable to his country,
that our Parnassus is fruitful only in
weeds, or at best in underwood. Notwithstanding
the general correctness
of this assertion, a modest wild-flower
now and then delights the eye, and
points that rainbow adventurer HOPE
to the brilliant future; in which some
master of song shall disclose in a
broad and clear light,</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Such forms as glitter in the Muse's ray.</i><br />
</p>

<p class="noind">American literature, it must be admitted,
is comparatively feeble in
many of its branches; but while the
names of <span class="smcap">Franklin</span> and <span class="smcap">Rush</span>, <span class="smcap">Dennie</span>
and <span class="smcap">Brown</span>, of <span class="smcap">Walsh</span> and <span class="smcap">Irving</span>,
are remembered, it is entitled
to the respectful consideration, even
of foreign criticism.</p>

<p>The extract given above is made
from a writer, who has furnished some
evidence of poetic talent in sundry occasional
playful pieces, published originally
in the New York Evening
Post, under the signature of <span class="smcap">Croaker</span>
&amp; Co. However unprepossessing may
be the name which he has chosen to
assume, his notes instead of reminding
us, as might be inferred, of the frog<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
or the raven; at times successfully
rival those of the favourite songsters
of the grove. From this stanza, we
learn that the author is a <span class="smcap">BACHELOR</span>;
who like too many of his brethren,
delights to dwell on the fancied cruelty
of the fair; and to pour the unheeded
complaints of his sorrows on
the dull and listless ear of indifference.
To this portion of society, little
commisseration is extended from
any quarter; and the general sentiment
is responsive to that contained
in the following couplet of <span class="smcap">Pope</span>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Let sinful bachelors their woes deplore;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Full well they merit all they feel and more.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Unpopular as such a doctrine might
appear, this condition of life has had
its advocates and defenders. Amongst
these may be placed that truly great
man, the eloquent and accomplished
apostle <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. When adverting to
this subject, he discovers something
of an unsocial disposition where he
says, "For I would that all men were
even as myself."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> "But I speak this
by permission, and not of commandment,"
says he, as if fearful that speculative
opinion might be received
from the weight of his character as
authority perfectly valid and conclusive.
<span class="smcap">Dryden</span> has asserted, that "a
true painter naturally delights in the
liberty which belongs to the bachelor's
estate." However specious this
position may appear, the liberal arts
are more indebted to the charities of
life, and to the influence of female excellence,
than the author of such a
sentiment would be willing to admit.
A vivid perception of physical and
moral beauty, delicacy of feeling, and
intellectual refinement, are indispensably
requisite in the artist who aspires
to eminence in his profession.
Nothing has a more direct and efficient
tendency to promote elegance
and correctness of taste than the society
of enlightened and polished females.
The absence of care is another
immunity which the <span class="smcap">BACHELOR</span> is
said to enjoy; but this as well as other
assumptions in his favour, but serves
to illustrate the fact, that on almost
any subject whatever, to use the language
of Sir <span class="smcap">Roger de Coverly</span>,
much may be said on both sides."</p>

<p>In all ages there have been from
various causes, a formidable array of
individuals of this class. The circumstances
connected with the present
times are, unfortunately, well calculated
to increase their number. To the
usual disastrous consequences produced
by "beauty's frown," the disappointments
and gloomy prospects in
business, deep rooted habits of idleness
and extravagance, by which the present
period is peculiarly distinguished,
may also be added. Active industry,
frugality, and temperance, should
be sedulously cultivated as moral virtues;
having a most important agency
in augmenting the stock of individual,
social, and political happiness. But
unamiable and repulsive as the character
of a <span class="smcap">BACHELOR</span> may too frequently
be, is it necessarily so?</p>

<p>Can he contemplate the condition
of childhood, surrounded with the pallid
spectres of poverty, and shooting
forth luxuriantly into all the noxious
forms of ignorance and vice;&mdash;can
he walk our streets or wharves when
his ear is saluted with their lisping
imprecations;&mdash;or witness their utter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
disregard of the duties which appertain
to the Sabbath,&mdash;without seriously
interrogating his own bosom&mdash;In
what way can any exertions of
mine improve their condition, and
promote their true interests?</p>

<p>Can he behold the increase of intemperance
and crime in all the ramifications
of society, without feeling
the influence of those sacred ties
which bind him to that community of
which he is a member; and without
resolving to use all diligence to arrest
their further extension, so far as
his influence and example may reach?</p>

<p>Can he listen with unconcern to the
cries of oppressed humanity, and view
without emotion, those objects of
wretchedness which almost daily present
themselves in the most affecting
shapes, and forget the intimate relationship,
and the reciprocity of duties
which exist between every branch of
the human family, and the justice and
force of the claims of distress upon
every generous and sympathetic
heart?</p>

<p>He can no where in the moral or
physical economy of the world, find
an example of existences which are
independent of all connection with
the present, past, and future. The
universe has been with great propriety
compared to a complex machine,
"a stupendous whole," every
part of which has its relative and proper
function to perform, and discord
and confusion are the consequence of
each irregularity of movement.</p>

<span class="i0">Tenth, or ten thousandth breaks the chain alike.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It should be the business of <em>every
one</em> to cultivate such sentiments as
those which are contained in the extract
below, given from a work<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> which
the celebrated <span class="smcap">Dugald Stewart</span> declared
when presenting a copy of it to
one of our countrymen, now a resident
of Philadelphia, to be the finest piece
of composition in the English language:
"<i>That to feel much for others,
and little for ourselves, that to restrain
our selfish, and to indulge our benevolent
affections, constitutes the perfection
of human nature; and can
alone produce among mankind that
harmony of sentiments and passions
in which consists their whole grace
and propriety.</i>" Even a <span class="smcap">BACHELOR</span>,
actuated by principles of this character,
might emerge into the character
of a worthy, useful, and amiable man!</p>

<p>Two trusses and a half of clover or
meadow hay cut and mixed with four
trusses of wheat, or barley straw,
when cut up, make nearly equal quantities

horse in twenty-four hours, being
previously mixed with half a peck of
corn, (in England oats) ground or
chopped, weight 5<i>lbs.</i> with water to
wet it; that is, 7 pounds of hay; 7
pounds of straw; 5 pounds of meal;
given at six different times, each day
and evening. Add 5 pounds of hay
at night, makes 24 pounds to each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
horse in twenty-four hours; and it
kept them much fatter than with
double the corn each day unground,
two trusses of hay a week.</p>

<p>An ox, unworked, eats about 32
pounds of meadow hay per day.</p>

<p>An ox at work eats 40 pounds a
day.</p>

<p>If fed in the stable each head of
horned cattle will eat 130 pounds
green clover just cut, or 30 pounds
clover hay a day.</p>

<p>At work, 3 horses eat in all, 48
stones a week of hay, also 48 quarts
of oats a week each horse.</p>

<p>At work 18 horses in 12 days, eat
430 stones of hay, which is 14 stones

Philadelphia, is one grape vine which
with its branches, covers 2170 square
feet of ground. On this one vine are
now grapes supposed to be forty bushels,
and probably much more. It
produced last year one barrel of
wine, which was made without sugar,
and is judged to be quite as good as
Madeira of the same age, by a man
brought up in the Madeira wine trade.
Under this vine the ground produced
a good crop of grass this season. It
is a native American vine, transplanted
from that same neighbourhood.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>If 2170 square feet produced 32
gallons, then one acre which is 43,560
square feet would produce about 20
barrels, or 640 gallons but allowing
space for avenues, say about 15 barrels,
or 480 gallons.</p>

<p>It is expected that the crop of
grapes for 1807 will produce much
more than those of 1806.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noind">
One acre yielding 480 gallons,<br />
at $1.00, is - - - $480.00<br />
at $1.50, is - - - $720.00<br />

<p>This holds out a profitable culture
to farmers.</p>

<h2>TO THE EDITORS OF THE RURAL MAGAZINE.</h2>


<p>The "<i>Philadelphia Society for Promoting
Agriculture</i>," at a late meeting, passed a
resolution to recommend the use of Malt
Liquors, in preference to Ardent Spirits,
on farms;&mdash;and appointed the subscribers
a Committee to procure and publish Directions
to enable Farmers to Brew Beer.&mdash;They
have accordingly the pleasure to send
a pamphlet published by the proprietors of
a patent English brewing apparatus, which
was imported by a gentleman of Philadelphia;
and also some directions by an eminent
brewer, to enable families to brew
beer with the common household utensils.
The apparatus was tried last year by one
of our members, and found to answer perfectly.&mdash;It
was imported with the view to
general utility, not to private profit, and
we understand may be purchased at first
cost.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<h2>DIRECTIONS FOR BREWING</h2>

<p class="center"><i>With Needham &amp; Co.'s Patent Portable
Family Brewing Machine.</i></p>


<p>As the attainment of good Malt
Liquor greatly depends upon the quality
of the materials from which it is
produced, it may be useful to give a
few general instructions for distinguishing
the quality of malt and hops,
of which it should be only composed;
but considerable practice being requisite
to form a ready judgment, it
will generally be more safe to buy
them of some reputable dealer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Malt.</span>&mdash;To judge of the quality
of malt, you must chew it, and if
<em>sweet, tender, and mealy, with a brisk
full flavour</em>, it is good; in coloured
malt particular care should be taken
that it is neither smoky nor burnt.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hops</span> should be of a <em>bright colour,
free from green leaves, of a quick
pungent smell, and glutinous quality</em>,
which will be discoverable by their
adhering together, and by rubbing
them in the hands. <em>New hops are
preferable to old, after Christmas.</em></p>

<p><i>To Brew Ale with Table Beer after,
from the same malt and hops.</i>&mdash;The
malt should be pale, sweet, and tender,
ground coarse, and the hops of
a pale bright colour and glutinous
quality.</p>

<p>If the ale is for present use, <sup><small>3</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>4</small></sub> of a
pound of hops to each bushel of malt
will be sufficient, but for store ale use
one pound per bushel.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/fig009-400dpi.jpg" width="450" height="527" alt="brewing equipment" />
</div>

<p>The machine being placed ready
for use as described in the plate,
figure G,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> put into it as much cold
water as will cover the perforated
bottom of the extracting cylinder, and
light the fire; then put as much
coarse ground malt into the perforated
cylinder, (see the plate, figure
D,) as will three parts fill it, taking
care that none goes into the centre,
(which centre should be covered,
(<em>but only</em>) while putting the malt in,
and when mashing the malt,) nor
any between the cylinder and boiler.&mdash;The
malt being put in, pour
through the centre as much more
cold water as will just cover the malt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a><br /><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
then make the fire good, and in one
hour after stir the malt well up with
a strong mashing stick, for about ten
minutes, so that every particle of malt
may be divided from the other: let
the heat increase to 180 degrees,
which you must ascertain by holding
the thermometer a minute in the centre
part of the machine, and when at
180 degrees of heat, stir the malt
again, and after this second stirring,
try the heat, and if then at 180 degrees,
damp the fire well with some
wet ashes to prevent the heat of the
mash from increasing, and in 3 hours
and a half from the time of lighting
the fire, draw off the wort very gently
that it may run fine, and put it into
one of the coolers, and put all the
hops (rubbing them through your
hands to break the lumps) on the top
of the wort to keep it hot till the time
for returning it into the machine for
boiling; having drawn off this ale
wort, put into the machine through
the centre as much more cold water
as will cover the grains, brisken the
fire, and in half an hour stir up the
malt for about ten minutes, and make
it 180 degrees of heat as quick as
you can, then damp the fire to prevent
its getting hotter, and in one
hour and a half from the time of putting
in the water, draw off this table
beer wort gently, that it may run
fine, and put it into the other cooler,
and cover it over to keep it hot until
the time for returning it into the machine
for boiling; having drawn off
this table beer wort, if you wish to
make a third wort, put in as much
more cold water into the machine as
you think proper, and make it 170
degrees of heat as quick as you can,
and draw it off in about an hour after,
and put it to the last drawing off, or
wort: then take the grains out of the
cylinder with a hand shovel as clean
as you can, and after, take out the
cylinder,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and with a birch broom and
a little water rince out the boiler
clean, and put back the perforated
cylinder into the boiler, and then put
the first drawing off or ale wort, with
all the hops, into the machine cylinder
where you have taken the grains from,
and cover the machine, but be sure
the centre cover is off; make it boil
as quick as you can, and let it boil
well one hour, then damp the fire and
draw it off into a cooler or coolers,
which should be placed in the air
where it will cool quick. Having
drawn off this ale wort, return the
second drawing off, or table beer
wort, with the third, into the machine
to the hops left from the ale wort,
stir up the fire and make it boil as
quick as you can, and let it boil well
one hour, then put out the fire and
draw off the wort, and put it into a
cooler placed in the air to cool quick;
when the worts in the coolers are
cooled down to 70 degrees of heat by
the thermometer, put the proportion
of a gill of fresh thick yeast to every
9 gallons of wort in the coolers, first
thinning the yeast with a little of the
wort before you put it in that it may
the better mix; and when the ale
wort is cooled down to 60 degrees of
heat, draw it off from the coolers with
the yeast and sediment, and put it into
the machine boiler (the machine
boiler having been previously cleared
from the hops and cylinder,) which
forms a convenient vessel placed on
its stand for the ale to ferment in,
which must be kept fermenting in it
with the cover off until the head has
the appearance of a thick brown yeast
on the surface, an inch or two deep,
which will take 3 or 4 days;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
the head has this appearance, draw off
the beer free from the yeast and bottoms
into a clean cask, which must be
filled full,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and when done working,
put in a handful of dry hops, bung it
down tight, and stow it in a cool cellar.
This ale will be fit to tap in 3 or
4 weeks.</p>

<p>The second wort for table beer
should be put from the coolers with
yeast and sediment into an upright
cask, with the cover off or top head
out, at not exceeding 60 degrees of
heat, and as soon as you perceive a
brown yeast on the surface, draw it off
free from the yeast and bottoms into
a clean cask, which must be kept
filled full, and when done working,
put in a handful of dry hops, bung it
down tight, and stow it in a cool cellar.
This table beer will be fit to tap
in a week, or as soon as fine.</p>

<p><i>To make Table Ale.</i>&mdash;Mix the first
and second worts together, and ferment,
and treat it the same as the ale.</p>

<p><i>To Brew Porter or Brown Beer,
with Table Beer after, from the same
Malt and Hops.</i>&mdash;Use pale and brown
malt in equal quantities, ground
coarse; and strong brown coloured
hops of a glutinous quality. If the
beer is for present draught, <sup><small>3</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>4</small></sub> pound
of hops to each bushel of malt will be
sufficient, but if intended for store
beer, use one pound to each bushel
of malt.</p>

<p>The process of brewing is the same
as described for brewing ale with table
beer after, except the heat of each
mash must not be so high by 10 degrees,
on account of the brown malt;
the first wort fermented by itself will
be stout porter, and fit to tap in 3 or
4 weeks; the second wort will be the
table beer, and fit to tap in a week, or
as soon as fine; but if you mix the
first and second worts together, the
same as for table ale, it will be good
common porter.</p>

<p><i>To Brew Table Beer only.</i>&mdash;Let
your malt be of one sort, of a full
yellow colour (not brown malt) ground
coarse, and strong brown coloured
hops, of a glutinous quality. If for
present draught <sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub> a pound of hops to
each bushel of malt will be sufficient,
but if for keeping two or 3 months,
use one pound of hops per bushel.</p>

<p>The process of brewing is the same
as described for brewing porter and
table beer, with the addition of another
wort, that is, filling the machine
a third time with water before you
take out the grains, and treating the
third mash the same as the second.</p>

<p>The first drawing off or wort, with
part of the second wort, to be boiled
(first) one hour with all the hops, and
the remainder of the second wort with
the third, to be boiled next one hour
to the same hops; these two boilings,
when cooled down to 60 degrees of
heat, (having put your yeast to it in
the coolers at 70 degrees) must be put
together to ferment in the machine
boiler, and as soon as it has the appearance
of a brown yeast on the surface,
draw it off into the casks, which
must be kept filled full, and when
done working, put into each cask a
handful of dry hops, bung it down
tight, and put it into a cool cellar.
Tap it in a week, or as soon as fine.</p>

<p><i>General Remarks.</i>&mdash;The season for
brewing sound keeping beer, is from
October to May.</p>

<p><i>All Beer should be stored in cool
cellars or vaults, and kept as much
as possible from the common atmosphere</i>;
and in drawing beer from a
cask, if necessary to raise the vent-peg,
it should be carefully tightened
as soon as the beer is drawn.</p>

<p>When beer is intended to be kept
many months, the bungs of the casks,
and if bell casks are used, the whole
of the head should be covered with
sand or clay, which should be kept
moist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p><i>To preserve the Machine.</i>&mdash;When
the brewing is over, wash the machine
and coolers with cold or hot water,
then dry them, and put them away in
a dry place. When wanted to be
used, they should be washed with boiling
water.</p>

<p><i>To keep Casks sweet.</i>&mdash;It is recommended
when a cask of beer is drawn
off, to take out the head and scrub
out the cask; then thoroughly dry
and put it away in a dry place with
the head out.</p>

<p>If it should be inconvenient to take
out the head, and the cask is wanted
to be filled again quickly, it may be
washed quite clean with warm water,
and afterwards with lime water; or
the grounds being left in the cask,
and every vent stopped, (bung, tap,
and vent holes,) it may be kept in that
state for a short time.</p>

<p>Casks of a bell shape are preferable
for private brewing, and the patentees
make them upon a principle by
which the inside can be scrubbed out
clean without removing the head, and
at the same price as common casks
of that shape.</p>

<p>The above calculation sufficiently proves that the Patent Brewing Machine
will, to the smallest Family who purchase Brewer's Beer, pay for itself in One
Year, and those who have been accustomed to Brew by the old Method, will
find the beer much stronger and better by using this Machine, and very considerably
less likely to be spoiled in Brewing, with a great saving in Fuel, Labour,
and Time.</p>
</div>

<p>As it may be inconvenient, or too
expensive, for many private families
to purchase a brewing machine, the
following Directions are subjoined,
which will enable them, by the aid of
the vessels used in a family, to brew
a barrel of beer; and by attention, and
a few experiments, they will produce
an excellent beverage.</p>

<p>Prepare a tub for making the extract,
by fitting a false bottom with
numerous holes, and raised about half
an inch from the real bottom, in which
fix a cock for drawing off the extract.
Have four bushels of malt coarsely
ground, and heat your water to about
170 or 175 degrees<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> of heat, of Fahrenheit's
thermometer. Then pour
in the tub about thirty-eight gallons
of the water, and gently stir in the
malt, until it is all mixed. Cover it,
and let it stand about an hour and a
half; draw off the extract into a vessel,
and throw in about one and a
quarter pounds of hops for liquor for
present use, or about two or two and
a half pounds for keeping liquors;
cover the vessel to keep in the heat,
and pour over the malt about 26 gallons
of water, of about the same heat
as the first, stirring it until it is well
mixed with the malt; let it stand one
hour, then draw off the extract, add
it to the first extract, and put them
on to boil in an open kettle: this will
be your strong beer. Then pour
over the malt about twenty gallons of
water, for small beer, at about 160 or
170 degrees of heat. This last will
not require stirring, and the extract<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
may remain covered until the kettle
is ready for it. Keep the strong beer
boiling smartly for about one hour
and a quarter, or one hour and a half,
for present use, or two hours for keeping:
then pour it through a sieve or
strainer, and set it to cool. Return
the hops into the kettle with your
third extract, or small beer, which
set to boiling as soon as practicable,
and continue it for about an hour and
a half; then pour it through the
strainer, and set it to cool. When
cool, ferment according to the directions
accompanying the brewing machine.
The quantity of water used
may be varied at the discretion of the
person brewing. By diminishing the
water, he may increase the strength
of the liquor, or by increasing it, diminish
the strength. Thus with the
hops he may vary the quantity to suit
his palate in the degree of bitter flavour
that may be most agreeable.&mdash;For
fomenting, a cask with one head
taken out, will answer the same purpose
as the machine boiler.</p>

<h2>THE SNOW STORM.</h2>

<p class="center">From Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, for April.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"'Tis only from the belief of the
goodness and wisdom of a Supreme
Being, that our calamities can be
borne in that manner which becomes
a man."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Henry Mackenzie.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In summer there is a beauty in
the wildest moors of Scotland, and
the wayfaring man who sits down
for an hour's rest beside some little
spring that flows unheard through
the brightened moss and water-cresses,
feels his weary heart revived by
the silent, serene, and solitary prospect.
On every side sweet sunny
spots of verdure smile towards him
from among the melancholy heather&mdash;unexpectedly
in the solitude a stray
sheep, it may be with its lambs, starts
half alarmed at his motionless figure&mdash;insects
large, bright, and beautiful
come careering by him through the
desert air&mdash;nor does the Wild want
its own songsters, the grey linnet, fond
of the blooming furze, and now and
then the lark mounting up to heaven
above the summits of the green pastoral
hills.&mdash;During such a sunshiny
hour, the lonely cottage on the waste
seems to stand a paradise; and as he
rises to pursue his journey, the traveller
looks back and blesses it with
a mingled emotion of delight and envy.
There, thinks he, abide the children
of innocence and contentment,
the two most benign spirits that watch
over human life.</p>

<p>But other thoughts arise in the
mind of him who may chance to journey
through the same scene in the
desolation of Winter. The cold bleak
sky girdles the moor as with a belt
of ice&mdash;life is frozen in air and on
earth. The silent is not of repose
but extinction&mdash;and should a solitary
human dwelling catch his eye half
buried in the snow, he is sad for the
sake of them whose destiny it is to
abide far from the cheerful haunts of
men, shrouded up in melancholy, by
poverty held in thrall, or pining away
in unvisited or untended sickness.</p>

<p>But, in truth, the heart of human
life is but imperfectly discovered
from its countenance; and before we
can know what the summer, or what
the winter yields for enjoyment or
trial to our country's peasantry, we
must have conversed with them in
their fields and by their fire-sides;
and make ourselves acquainted with
the powerful ministry of the seasons,
not over those objects alone that feed
the eye and the imagination, but over
all the incidents, occupations, and
events that modify or constitute the
existence of the poor.</p>

<p>I have a short and simple story to
tell of the winter life of the moorland
cottager&mdash;a story but of one evening&mdash;with
a few events and no signal
catastrophe&mdash;but which may haply
please those hearts whose delight it
is to think on the humble under-plots
that are carrying on in the great Drama
of life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>Two cottagers, husband and wife,
were sitting by their cheerful peat-fire
one winter evening, in a small
lonely hut, on the edge of a wide
moor, at some miles distance from
any other habitation. There had
been, at one time, several huts of the
same kind erected close together,
and inhabited by families of the poorest
class of day-labourers who found
work among the distant farms, and at
night returned to dwellings which
were rent free, with their little gardens,
won from the waste.&mdash;But one
family after another had dwindled
away, and the turf-built huts had all
fallen into ruins, except one that had
always stood in the centre of this little
solitary village, with its summer
walls covered with the richest honeysuckles
and in the midst of the
brightest of all the gardens. It alone
now sent up its smoke into the clear
winter sky&mdash;and its little end window,
now lighted up, was the only ground
star that shone towards the belated traveller,
if any such ventured to cross,
on a winter night, a scene so dreary
and desolate. The affairs of the small
household were all arranged for the
night. The little rough pony that
had drawn in a sledge, from the heart
of the Black-Moss, the fuel by whose
blaze the cottiers were now sitting
cheerily and the little Highland cow,
whose milk enabled them to live,
were standing amicably together, under
cover of a rude shed, of which
one side was formed by the peat
stack, and which was at once byre,
and stable, and hen-roost. Within,
the clock ticked cheerfully as the
fire-light readied its old oak-wood
case across the yellow sanded floor&mdash;and
a small round table stood between,
covered with a snow-white
cloth, on which were milk and oat
cakes, the morning, mid-day, and
evening meal of these frugal and contented
cottiers. The spades and the
mattocks of the labourer were collected
into one corner, and showed
that the succeeding day was the blessed
Sabbath&mdash;while on the wooden
chimney-piece were seen lying an
open Bible ready for family worship.</p>

<p>The father and mother were sitting
together without opening their
lips, but with their hearts overflowing
with happiness, for on this Saturday-night
they were, every minute,
expecting to hear at the latch the
hand of their only daughter, a maiden
of about fifteen years, who was at service
with a farmer over the hills.
This dutiful child was, as they knew,
to bring home to them "her sair-worn
penny fee," a pittance which,
in the beauty of her girl-hood, she
earned singing at her work, and
which, in the benignity of that sinless
time, she would pour with tears into
the bosoms she so dearly loved. Forty
shillings a year were all the wages
of sweet Hannah Lee&mdash;but though
she wore at her labour a tortoise-shell
comb in her auburn hair, and
though in the kirk none were more
becomingly arrayed than she, one
half, at least, of her earnings were to
be reserved for the holiest of all purposes,
and her kind innocent heart
was gladdened when she looked on
the little purse that was, on the long
expected Saturday-night, to be taken
from her bosom, and put, with a
blessing, into the hand of her father,
now growing old at his daily toils.</p>

<p>Of such a child the happy cottiers
were thinking in their silence. And
well might they be called happy. It
is at that sweet season that filial piety
is most beautiful.&mdash;Their own
Hannah, had just outgrown the mere
unthinking gladness of childhood, but
had not yet reached that time, when
inevitable selfishness mixes with the
pure current of love. She had begun
to think on what her affectionate
heart had felt so long; and when she
looked on the pale face and bending
frame of her mother, on the deepening
wrinkles, and whitening hairs of
her father, often would she lie weeping
for their sakes on her midnight
bed&mdash;and wish that she was beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
them as they slept, that she might
kneel down and kiss them, and mention
their names over and over again
in her prayer. The parents whom
before she had only loved, her expanding
heart now also venerated.
With gushing tenderness was now
mingled a holy fear and an awful reverence.
She had discerned the relation
in which she, an only child,
stood to her poor parents now that
they were getting old, and there was
not a passage in Scripture that spake
of parents or of children, from Joseph
sold into slavery, to Mary weeping
below the Cross, that was not
written, never to be obliterated, on
her uncorrupted heart.</p>

<p>The father rose from his seat, and
went to the door to look out into the
night.&mdash;The stars were in thousands&mdash;and
the full moon was risen.&mdash;It
was almost light as day, and the snow,
that seemed incrusted with diamonds,
was so hardened by the frost, that
his daughter's homeward feet would
leave no mark on its surface. He
had been toiling all day among the
distant Castle-woods, and, stiff and
wearied as he now was, he was almost
tempted to go to meet his child, but
his wife's kind voice dissuaded him,
and returning to the fire-side, they
began to talk of her whose image
had been so long passing before them
in their silence.</p>

<p>"She is growing up to be a bony
lassie," said the mother, "her long
and weary attendance on me during
my fever last spring kept her down
awhile&mdash;but now she is sprouting fast
and fair as a lily, and may the blessing
of God be as dew and as sunshine
to our sweet flower all the days she
bloometh upon this earth." "Aye
Agnes," replied the father, "we are
not very old yet&mdash;though we are getting
older&mdash;and a few years will bring
her to women's estate, and what thing
on this earth, think ye, human or
brute, would ever think of injuring
her? Why I was speaking about her
yesterday to the minister as he was
riding by, and he told me that none
answered at the Examination in the
Kirk so well as Hannah.&mdash;Poor thing&mdash;I
well think she has all the Bible
by heart&mdash;indeed, she has read but
little else&mdash;only some stories, too true
ones, of the blessed martyrs, and some
o' the auld sangs o' Scotland, in which
there is nothing but what is good, and
which, to be sure, she sings, God
bless her, sweeter than any laverock."
"Aye&mdash;were we both to die this very
night, she would be happy&mdash;not
that she would forget us, all the days
of her life. But have you not seen,
husband, that God always makes the
orphan happy?&mdash;None so little lonesome
as they! They come to make
friends o' all the bonny and sweet
things in the world around them, and
all the kind hearts in the world make
friends o' them. They come to know
that God is more especially the father
o' them on earth whose parents
he has taken up to heaven&mdash;and therefore
it is that they for whom so many
have fears, fear not at all for themselves,
but go dancing and singing
along like children whose parents are
both alive! Would it not be so with
our dear Hannah? So douce and
thoughtful a child&mdash;but never sad nor
miserable&mdash;ready it is true to shed
tears for little, but as ready to dry
them up and break out into smiles! I
know not why it is, husband, but this
night my heart warms toward her,
beyond usual. The moon and stars
are at this moment looking down
upon her, and she looking up to them,
as she is glinting homewards over
the snow. I wish she were but here,
and taking the comb out o' her bonny
hair, and letting it all fall down in
clusters before the fire, to melt away
the cranreuch!"</p>

<p>While the parents were thus speaking
of their daughter a loud sugh of
wind came suddenly over the cottage,
and the leafless ash-tree under whose
shelter it stood, creaked and groaned
dismally, as it passed by.&mdash;The father
started up, and going again to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
door, saw that a sudden change had
come over the face of the night. The
moon had nearly disappeared, and
was just visible in a dim yellow, glimmering
in the sky.&mdash;All the remote
stars were obscured, and only one or
two faintly seemed in a sky that half
an hour before was perfectly cloudless,
but that was now driven with
rack, and mist, and sleet, the whole
atmosphere being in commotion. He
stood for a single moment to observe
the direction of this unforseen storm,
and then hastily asked for his staff.
"I thought I had been more weather-wise&mdash;A
storm is coming down
from the Cairnbrae-hawse, and we
shall have nothing but a wild night."
He then whistled on his dog&mdash;an old
sheep dog, too old for its former labours
and set off to meet his daughter,
who might then, for aught he
knew, be crossing the Black-moss.</p>

<p>The mother accompanied her husband
to the door, and took a long
frightened look at the angry sky. As
she kept gazing, it became still more
terrible. The last shred of blue was
extinguished&mdash;the wind went whirling
in roaring eddies, and great flakes
of snow circled about in the middle
air, whether drifted up from the
ground, or driven down from the
clouds, the fear-striken mother knew
not, but she at least knew, that it
seemed a night of danger, despair,
and death. "Lord have mercy on
us James, what will become of our
poor bairn!" But her husband heard
not her words, for he was already out
of sight in the snow storm, and she
was left to the terror of her own soul
in that lonesome cottage.</p>

<p>Little Hannah Lee had left her
master's house, soon as the rim of the
great moon was seen by her eyes,
that had been long anxiously watching
it from the window, rising like a
joyful dream, over the gloomy mountain-tops;
and all by herself she tripped
along beneath the beauty of the
silent heaven. Still as she kept ascending
and descending the knolls
that lay in the bosom of the glen, she
sung to herself a song, a hymn, or a
psalm, without the accompaniment of
the streams, now all silent in the frost;
and ever and anon she stopped to try
to count the stars that lay in some
more beautiful part of the sky, or gazed,
on the constellations that she
knew, and called them, in her joy,
by the names they bore among the
shepherds.&mdash;There were none to hear
her voice, or see her smiles, but
the ear and eye of Providence. As
on she glided and took her looks
from heaven, she saw her own little
fire-side&mdash;her parents waiting for her
arrival&mdash;the bible opened for worship&mdash;her
own little room kept so neatly
for her, with its mirror hanging by
the window, in which to braid her
hair by the morning light&mdash;her bed
prepared for her by her mother's
hand&mdash;the primroses in her garden
peeping through the snow&mdash;old Tray,
who ever welcomed her home with
his dim white eyes&mdash;the poney and
the cow; friends all, and inmates of
that happy household. So stepped
she along, while the snow diamonds
glittering around her feet, and the
frost wove a wreath of lucid pearls
around her forehead.</p>

<p>She had now reached the edge of
the Black-moss, which lay half way
between her master's and her father's
dwelling, when she heard a loud
noise coming down from Glen-Scrae,
and in a few seconds, she felt on her
face some flakes of snow. She looked
up the glen, and saw the snow
storm coming down, fast as a flood.
She felt no fears; but she ceased her
song; and had there been a human
eye to look upon her there, it might
have seen a shadow on her face.
She continued her course, and felt
bolder and bolder every step that
brought her nearer to her parent's
house. But the snow storm had now
reached the Black-moss, and the
broad line of light that had lain in
the direction of her home, was soon
swallowed up, and the child was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
utter darkness. She saw nothing but
the flakes of snow, interminably intermingled,
and furiously wafted in
the air, close to her head; she heard
nothing but one wild, fierce, fitful
howl. The cold became intense, and
her little feet and hands were fast,
being benumbed into insensibility.</p>

<p>"It is a fearful change," muttered
the child to herself, but still she did
not fear, for she had been born in a
moorland cottage, and lived all her
days among the hardships of the hills.&mdash;"What
will become of the poor
sheep," thought she,&mdash;but still she
scarcely thought of her own danger,
for innocence and youth, and joy, are
slow to think of ought evil befalling
themselves, and thinking benignly of
all living things, forget their own fear
in their pity of others' sorrow.&mdash;At
last, she could no longer discern a
single mark on the snow, either of
human steps, or of sheep track, or
the foot print of a wild-fowl. Suddenly,
too, she felt out of breath and
exhausted,&mdash;and shedding tears for
herself at last sank down in the snow.</p>

<p>It was now that her heart began to
quake for fear. She remembered
stories of the shepherds lost in the
snow,&mdash;of a mother and child frozen
to death on that very moor,&mdash;and, in
a moment she knew that she was to
die. Bitterly did the poor child weep,
for death was terrible to her, who,
though poor, enjoyed the bright little
world of youth and innocence. The
skies of heaven were dearer than she
knew to her,&mdash;so were the flowers of
earth. She had been happy at her
work&mdash;happy in her sleep&mdash;happy in
the kirk on Sabbath. A thousand
thoughts had the solitary child,&mdash;and
in her own heart was a spring of happiness,
pure and undisturbed as any
fount that sparkles unseen all the
year through, in some quiet nook
among the pastoral hills. But now
there was to be an end of all this,&mdash;she
was to be frozen to death&mdash;and
lie there till the thaw might come;
and then her father would find her
body, and carry it away to be buried
in the kirk-yard.</p>

<p>The tears were frozen on her
cheeks as soon as shed&mdash;and scarcely
had her little hands strength to
clasp themselves together, as she
thought of an overruling and merciful
Lord came across her heart.
Then, indeed, the fears of this religious
child were calmed, and she
heard without terror, the plover's
wailing cry, and the deep boom of
the bittern sounding in the moss. "I
will repeat the Lord's prayer." And
drawing her plaid more closely
around her, she whispered beneath
its ineffectual cover; "Our Father
which art in heaven, hallowed be thy
name,&mdash;thy kingdom come&mdash;thy will
be done on earth as it is in heaven."
Had human aid been within fifty
yards, it could have been of no avail&mdash;eye
could not see her&mdash;ear could
not hear her in that howling darkness.
But that low prayer was heard
in the centre of eternity&mdash;and that
little sinless child was lying in the
snow, beneath the all-seeing eye of
God.</p>

<p>The maiden having prayed to her
Father in Heaven&mdash;then thought of
her Father on earth. Alas! they
were not far separated! The father
was lying but a short distance from
his child; he too had sunk down in
the drifting snow, after having in less
than an hour, exhausted all the
strength of fear, pity, hope, despair,
and resignation, that could rise in a
father's heart, blindly seeking to rescue
his only child from death, thinking
that one desperate exertion might
enable them to die in each other's
arms. There they lay, within a
stone's throw of each other, while a
huge snow drift was every moment
piling itself up into a more insurmountable
barrier between the dying
parent and his dying child.</p>

<p>There was all this while a blazing
fire in the cottage&mdash;a white spread
table&mdash;and beds prepared for the family
to lie down in peace. Yet was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
she who sat thereon more to be pitied
than the old man and the child
stretched upon the snow. "I will
not go to seek them&mdash;that would be
tempting Providence&mdash;and wilfully
putting out the lamp of life. No! I
will abide here, and pray for their
souls?" Then as she knelt down,
looked she at the useless fire burning
away so cheerfully, when all she
loved might be dying of cold&mdash;and
unable to bear the thought, she
shrieked out a prayer, as if she might
pierce the sky up to the very throne
of God, and send with it her own miserable
soul, to plead before Him for
the deliverance of her child and husband.&mdash;She
then fell down in blessed
forgetfulness of all trouble, in the
midst of the solitary cheerfulness of
that bright-burning hearth&mdash;and the
bible, which she had been trying to
read in the pause of her agony, remained
clasped in her hands.</p>

<p>Hannah Lee had been a servant
for more than six months&mdash;and it
was not to be thought that she was
not beloved in her master's family.
Soon after she had left the house,
her master's son, a youth of about
eighteen years, who had been among
the hills, looking after the sheep,
came home, and was disappointed to
find that he had lost an opportunity of
accompanying Hannah part of the
way to her father's cottage. But the
hour of eight had gone by, and not
even the company of young William
Grieve, could induce the kind-hearted
daughter to delay sitting out on
her journey, a few minutes beyond
the time promised to her parents. "I
do not like the night," said William&mdash;"there
will be a fresh fall of snow
soon, or the witch of Glen Scrae
is a liar, for a snow-cloud is hanging
o'er the birch-tree-linn, and it may
be down to the Black-moss as soon
as Hannah Lee." So he called his
two sheep dogs, that had taken their
place under the long table before
the window, and set out, half in joy,
half in fear, to overtake Hannah
and see her safely across the Black-moss.</p>

<p>The snow began to drift so fast,
that before he had reached the head
of the Glen, there was nothing to be
seen but a little bit of the wooden rail
of the bridge across the Sauch burn.
William Grieve was the most active
shepherd in a large pastoral parish&mdash;he
had often passed the night among
the wintery hills for the sake of a few
sheep, and all the snow that had ever
fell from Heaven, would not have
made him turn back when Hannah
Lee was before him; and as his terrified
heart told him, in imminent
danger of being lost.&mdash;As he advanced,
he felt that it was no longer a
walk of love or friendship, for which
he had been glad of an excuse. Death
stared him in the face, and his young
soul, now beginning to feel all the
passions of youth, was filled with
phrenzy. He had seen Hannah every
day&mdash;at the fire-side&mdash;at work&mdash;in
the kirk&mdash;on holydays&mdash;at prayers&mdash;bringing
supper to his aged parents&mdash;smiling
and singing about the house
from morning till night. She had
often brought his own meal to him
among the hills&mdash;and he now found,
that though he had never talked to
her about love, except smilingly, and
playfully, that he loved her beyond
father or mother, or his own soul.
"I will save thee, Hannah," he cried
with a loud sob, "or lie down beside
thee in the snow&mdash;and we will die
together in our youth." A wild
whistling wind went by him, and the
snow-flakes whirled so fiercely round
his head, that he staggered on for a
while in utter blindness. He knew
the path that Hannah must have taken,
and went forward shouting aloud,
and stopping every twenty yards to
listen for a voice. He sent his well
trained dogs over the snow in all directions&mdash;repeating
to them her name
"Hannah Lee," that the dumb animals
might, in their sagacity, know
for whom they were searching; and
as they looked up in his face, and set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
off to scour the moor, he almost believed
that they knew his meaning,
(and it is probable they did) and were
eager to find in her bewilderment the
kind maiden by whose hand they had
so often been fed. Often went they
off into the darkness, and as often returned,
but their looks showed that
every quest had been in vain. Meanwhile
the snow was of a fearful depth,
and falling without intermission or
diminution. Had the young shepherd
been thus alone, walking across
the moor on his ordinary business, it
is probable that he might have been
alarmed for his own safety&mdash;nay, that
in spite of all his strength and agility,
he might have sunk down beneath
the inclemency of the night and perished.
But now, the passion of his
soul carried him with supernatural
strength along, and extricated him
from wreath and pitfall. Still there
was no trace of poor Hannah Lee&mdash;and
one of his dogs at last came close
to his feet, worn out entirely, and
afraid to leave its master&mdash;while the
other was mute, and, as the shepherd
thought, probably unable to
force its way out of some hollow or
through some floundering drift.&mdash;Then
he all at once knew that Hannah
Lee was dead&mdash;and dashed himself
down in the snow in a fit of passion.</p>

<p>It was the first time that the youth
had ever been sorely tried&mdash;all his
hidden and unconscious love for the
fair lost girl had flowed up from the
bottom of his heart&mdash;and at once the
sole object which had blessed his life
and made him the happiest of the
happy, was taken away and cruelly
destroyed&mdash;so that sullen, wrathful,
baffled and despairing, there he lay,
cursing his existence, and in too great
agony to think of prayer. "God,"
he then thought, "has forsaken me&mdash;and
why should he think on me,
when he suffers one so good and beautiful
as Hannah to be frozen to death."
God thought both of him and Hannah&mdash;and
through his infinite mercy forgave
the sinner in his wild turbulence
of passion. William Grieve had never
gone to bed without joining in
prayer&mdash;and he revered the Sabbath-day
and kept it holy. Much is forgiven
to the human heart by him who
so fearfully framed it; and God is not
slow to pardon the love which one
human being bears to another, in his
frailty&mdash;even though that love forget
or arraign his own unsleeping providence.
His voice has told us to love
one another&mdash;and William loved Hannah
in simplicity, innocence, and truth.
That she should perish, was a thought
so dreadful, that, in its agony God
seemed a ruthless being&mdash;"blow&mdash;blow&mdash;blow&mdash;and
drift us up for ever&mdash;we
cannot be far asunder&mdash;O Hannah&mdash;Hannah&mdash;think
ye not that the
fearful God has forsaken us?"</p>

<p>As the boy groaned these words
passionately through his quivering
lips, there was a sudden lowness in
the air, and he heard the barking of
his absent dog, while the one at his
feet hurried off in the direction of
the sound, and soon loudly joined the
cry. It was not a bark of surprise&mdash;or
anger&mdash;or fear&mdash;but of recognition
and love. William sprung up from
his bed in the snow and with his
heart knocking at his bosom even to
sickness, he rushed headlong through
the drifts, with a giant's strength, and
fell down half dead with joy and terror
beside the body of Hannah Lee.</p>

<p>But he soon recovered from that
fit, and lifting the cold corpse in his
arms, he kissed her lips, and her
cheeks, and her forehead, and her
closed eyes, till, as he kept gazing
on her face in utter despair, her head
fell back on his shoulder, and a long
deep sigh came from her inmost bosom.&mdash;"She
is yet alive thank God!"&mdash;and
as that expression left his lips
for the first time that night, he felt a
pang of remorse:" "I said, O God,
that thou hadst forsaken us&mdash;I am not
worthy to be saved; but let not this
maiden perish, for the sake of her parents,
who have no other child."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>The distracted youth prayed to
God with the same earnestness as if
he had been beseeching a fellow creature,
in whose hand was the power of
life and of death. The presence of
the Great Being was felt by him in
the dark and howling wild, and strength
was imparted to him as to a deliverer.
He bore along the fair child in his
arms, even as if she had been a lamb.
The snow drift blew not&mdash;the wind
fell dead&mdash;a sort of glimmer, like
that of an upbreaking and departing
storm, gathered about him&mdash;his dogs
barked and jumped, and burrowed
joyfully in the snow&mdash;and the youth,
strong in sudden hope, exclaimed,
"With the blessing of God, who has
not deserted us in our sore distress,
will I carry thee, Hannah, in my
arms, and lay thee down alive in the
house of thy father."&mdash;At this moment
there were no stars in Heaven,
but she opened her dim blue eyes
upon him on whose bosom she was
unconsciously lying, and said, as in a
dream, "Send the riband that ties up
my hair, as a keepsake to William
Grieve." "She thinks that she is on
her death bed, and forgets not the
son of her master. It is the voice of
God that tells me she will not now
die, and that, under His grace, I shall
be her deliverer."</p>

<p>The short lived rage of the storm
was soon over, and William could attend
to the beloved being on his bosom.
The warmth of his heart seemed
to infuse life into her's; and as he
gently placed her feet on the snow,
till he muffled her up in his plaid,
as well as in her own, she made an
effort to stand, and with extreme perplexity
and bewilderment, faintly inquired,
where she was, and what fearful
catastrophe had befallen them?
She was, however, too weak to walk;
and as her young master carried her
along, she murmured, "O William!
what if my father be in the moor?&mdash;For
if you, who need care so little
about me, have come hither, as I suppose
to save my life, you may be sure
that my father sat not within doors
during the storm." As she spoke it
was calm below, but the wind was
still alive in the upper air, and cloud,
rack, mist, and sleet, were all driving
about in the sky. Out shone for a
moment the pallid and ghostly moon,
through a rent in the gloom, and by
that uncertain light, came staggering
forward the figure of a man.&mdash;"Father&mdash;Father,"
cried Hannah&mdash;and
his gray hairs were already on her
cheek. The barking of the dogs and
the shouting of the young shepherd
had struck his ear, as the sleep of
death was stealing over him, and with
the last effort of benumbed nature, he
had roused himself from that fatal
torpor and prest through the snow
wreath that had separated him from
his child. As yet they knew not of
the danger each had endured&mdash;but
each judged of the other's suffering
from their own, and father and daughter
regarded one another as creatures
rescued, and hardly yet rescued from
death.</p>

<p>But a few minutes ago, and the
three human beings who loved each
other so well, and now feared not to
cross the Moor in safety, were, as they
thought, on their death beds. Deliverance
now shone upon them all like
a gentle fire, dispelling that pleasant
but deadly drowsiness; and the old
man was soon able to assist William
Grieve in leading Hannah along
through the snow. Her colour and
her warmth returned, and her lover&mdash;for
so might he well now be called&mdash;felt
her heart gently beating against
her side. Filled as that heart was with
gratitude to God, joy in her deliverance,
love to her father, and purest affection
for her master's son, never before
had the innocent maiden known
what was happiness&mdash;and never more
was she to forget it. The night was
now almost calm, and fast returning
to its former beauty&mdash;when the party
saw the first twinkle of the fire
through the low window of the Cottage
of the Moor. They soon were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
at the garden gate&mdash;and to relieve
the heart of the wife and mother
within, they talked loudly and cheerfully&mdash;naming
each other familiarly,
and laughing between, like persons
who had known neither danger nor
distress.</p>

<p>No voice answered from within&mdash;no
footsteps came to the door which
stood open, as when the father had
left it in his fear, and now he thought
with affright, that his wife, feeble as
she was, had been unable to support
the loneliness, and had followed him
out into the night, never to be brought
home alive.&mdash;As they bore Hannah
into the house, his fear gave way to
worse, for there upon the hard clay
floor lay the mother upon her face,
as if murdered by some savage blow.
She was in the same deadly swoon
into which she had fallen on her husband's
departure, three hours before.
The old man raised her up, and her
pulse was still&mdash;so was her heart&mdash;her
face pale and sunken&mdash;and her
body cold as ice. "I have recovered
a daughter," said the old man,
"but I have lost a wife;" and he
carried her, with a groan, to the bed
on which he laid her lifeless body.
The sight was too much for Hannah,
worn out as she was, and who had
hitherto been able to support herself
in the delightful expectation of
gladdening her mother's heart by her
safe arrival. She, too, now swooned
away, and, as she was placed on the
bed beside her mother, it seemed, indeed
that death, disappointed of his
prey on the wild moor, had seized it
in the cottage, and by the fire-side.
The husband knelt down by the bed-side,
and held his wife's icy hand in
his, while William Grieve appalled,
and awe-stricken, hung over his Hannah,
and inwardly implored God that
the night's wild adventure might not
have so ghastly an end. But Hannah's
young heart soon began once more to
beat&mdash;and soon as she came to her
recollection, she rose up with a face
whiter than ashes, and free from all
smiles, as if none had ever played
there, and joined her father and young
master in their efforts to restore her
mother to life.</p>

<p>It was the mercy of God that had
struck her down to the earth, insensible
to the shrieking winds, and the
fears that would otherwise have killed
her. Three hours of that wild storm
had passed over her head, and she
heard nothing more than if she had
been asleep in a breathless night of
the summer dew. Not even a dream
had touched her brain, and when she
opened her eyes which, as she thought
had been but a moment shut, she had
scarcely time to recal to her recollection
the image of her husband rushing
out into the storm, and of a daughter
therein lost, till she beheld that
very husband kneeling tenderly by
her bed-side, and that very daughter
smoothing the pillow on which her
aching temples reclined. But she
knew from the white steadfast countenances
before her that there had been
tribulation and deliverance, and she
looked on the beloved beings ministering
by her bed, as more fearfully
dear to her from the unimagined danger
from which she felt assured they
had been rescued by the arm of the
Almighty.</p>

<p>There is little need to speak of
returning recollection, and returning
strength. They had all now power
to weep, and power to pray. The
Bible had been lying in its place ready
for worship&mdash;and the father read
aloud that chapter in which is narrated
our Saviour's act of miraculous
power, by which he saved Peter from
the sea. Soon as the solemn thoughts
awakened by that act of mercy so similar
to that which had rescued
themselves from death had subsided,
and they had all risen up from prayer,
they gathered themselves in gratitude
round the little table which had
stood so many hours spread&mdash;and exhausted
nature was strengthened and
restored by a frugal and simple meal
partaken of in silent thankfulness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>The whole story of the night was
then calmly recited&mdash;and when the
mother heard how the stripling had
followed her sweet Hannah into the
storm, and borne her in his arms
through a hundred drifted heaps&mdash;and
then looked upon her in her
pride, so young, so innocent, and so
beautiful, she knew, that were the
child indeed to become an orphan,
there was one, who, if there was either
trust in nature, or truth in religion,
would guard and cherish her all
the days of her life.</p>

<p>It was not nine o'clock when the
storm came down from Glen Scrae
upon the Black-moss, and now in a
pause of silence the clock struck
twelve. Within these three hours
William and Hannah had led a life
of trouble and of joy, that had enlarged
and kindled their hearts within
them&mdash;and they felt that henceforth
they were to live wholly for each
other's sakes. His love was the proud
and exulting love of a deliverer, who,
under Providence, had saved from the
frost and the snow the innocence and
the beauty of which his young passionate
heart had been so desperately
enamoured&mdash;and he now thought of
his own Hannah Lee ever more moving
about in his father's house, not
as a servant, but as a daughter&mdash;and
when some few happy years had gone
by, his own most beautiful and most
loving wife. The innocent maiden
still called him her young master&mdash;but
was not ashamed of the holy affection
which she now knew that she
had long felt for the fearless youth on
whose bosom she had thought herself
dying in that cold and miserable
moor. Her heart leapt within her
when she heard her parents bless
him by his name&mdash;and when he took
her hand into his before them, and
vowed before that Power who had that
night saved them from the snow, that
Hannah Lee should ere long be his
wedded wife&mdash;she wept and sobbed as
if her heart would break in a fit of
strange and insupportable happiness.</p>

<p>The young shepherd rose to bid
them farewell&mdash;"my father will think
I am lost," said he, with a grave
smile, "and my Hannah's mother
knows what it is to fear for a child."
So nothing was said to detain him,
and the family went with him to the
door. The skies smiled serenely as
if a storm had never swept before the
stars&mdash;the moon was sinking from
her meridian, but in cloudless splendour&mdash;and
the hollow of the hills was
hushed as that of heaven. Danger
there was none over the placid night-scene&mdash;the
happy youth soon crost
the Black-moss, now perfectly still&mdash;and,
perhaps, just as he was passing,
with a shudder of gratitude, the very
spot where his sweet Hannah Lee
had so nearly perished, she was lying
down to sleep in her innocence, or
dreaming of one now dearer to her
than all on earth but her parents.</p>

<h2>MY NEIGHBOUR EPHRAIM.</h2>


<p>I went this afternoon to pay a visit
to my neighbour Ephraim; indeed I
find his cheerful fire-side so much
more pleasant than my own little solitary
dwelling, that I am afraid I go
there rather too often; however, as
yet I have not remarked any coldness
or distance in their reception of me.
Ephraim had been a little indisposed,
and I found him reclining on the sofa;
his wife was preparing something
comfortable for him by the fire, and
his daughter, having arranged his
pillow to his mind, sat with her work
at his feet, while Ezekiel read to him&mdash;his
other son was engaged in superintending
the business of the farm;
but when the hour of tea approached,
he joined the circle in the parlour
with a smiling countenance, cheeks
glowing with health, and an appetite
which appeared in no wise diminished
by the exercise of the day. When
I returned to my own lonely habitation,
I could not avoid contrasting a
little my situation with that of my old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
friend. Happy Ephraim! said I,
thou hast an excellent wife and dutiful
daughter, to smooth the pillow of
thy aching head, to hover with feathery
footsteps around thy peaceful
couch, and watch over thy slumbers
with the assiduity of anxious love&mdash;thou
hast two manly intelligent sons,
to attend to thy business, to protect
thy interests, and support thy tottering
steps; whose only strife is that of
kindness, whose only rivalship, which
shall be most attentive to thee, each
of whom would gladly say with the
poet,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Me, may the gentle office long engage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rock the cradle of reposing age.&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">And when at last, in a good old age,
thou shalt be gathered to thy fathers,
a train of mourning relatives shall
deposit with decent care thy cherished
remains in the narrow house appointed
for all living; while I stand
alone in the world, an insulated, insignificant
being, for whom no one
feels an interest, and whose pains and
pleasures are of consequence to no
one; whose approach is greeted with
no smile, and whose departure excites
no regret, and when the closing
scene approaches, no kindred hand
shall support my throbbing temples,
or prepare the potion for my feverish
lip, but mercenary eyes alone mark
with ill disguised impatience the uncertain
flutter of the lingering pulse,
mercenary attendants only receive,
with frigid indifference, the last farewell
of the departing spirit&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"By strangers' hands my dying eyes be clos'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"By strangers' hands my lifeless limbs compos'd."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">Lost in a train of such like melancholy
musings, and pondering on the past,
the present and the future, I had suffered
my fire to become nearly extinguished,
and the feeble glimmer
of my untrimmed taper faintly illumined
my little study, when I was
roused from my revery by the entrance
of Ezekiel and his sister: The
good girl said she had remarked that
I was more silent than usual, and as
the evening was fine, they had come
over to see if I was unwell: this little
act of kindness, though in itself no
way remarkable, yet coming at such
a moment, affected me not a little.&mdash;But
I must shake off this gloom and
depression of spirit, I am not now to
learn that the world had much rather
laugh <em>with</em> or <em>at</em> a man than mourn
with him; I did not sit down to lament
the desolation of my own situation,
which cannot now be remedied;
but to exhort the young to get married,
to encourage them by the example
of Ephraim, and to warn them
of my own: "Do nothing in a hurry,"
is an excellent maxim in the main,
but in some cases it is possible to use
too much deliberation; in the important
business of taking a wife, many
a man has debated and deliberated,
until the season for acting has passed
away. An old fellow like myself has
little to do in the world, but to talk
for the benefit of his neighbours; and
I would willingly devote my experience
to the service of the rising generation.
I should feel no objection
to narrate the disastrous consequences
of my own superabundant caution in
the affair of matrimony, and to enumerate
the many eligible matches
which have slipped through my fingers;
the opportunities to form advantageous
connexions which have
been unimproved in consequence of
my hesitation and indecision, for I
have now no plans to be defeated or
prospects blasted by a knowledge of
my failings, and no vanity to be mortified
by the exposure of my disappointments,
but I am apprehensive
the detail might prove rather tedious
and uninteresting; I may, however,
mention a few circumstances attending
my last attempts to obtain a help
mate, if attempt it may be called. I
had become acquainted in the family
of a respectable farmer, who had a
daughter of a suitable age, and although
I cannot say that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Grace was in all her steps, heaven in her eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"In every motion, dignity and love,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">yet her correct and orderly deportment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
seemed to promise that she
would make an excellent wife; I was
therefore pretty frequent in my visits,
and though on these occasions my
discourse was principally, if not entirely,
addressed to the parents, yet I
kept a sharp eye upon the daughter,
in order to endeavour to form a tolerable
estimate of her disposition
and character; and as I had in those
days a handsome little estate at my
own disposal, and was upon the whole
considered rather a promising young
man, my company seemed always
very acceptable, to the father and mother
at least.</p>

<p>In this manner, eight or ten months,
perhaps, passed pleasantly away, and
I was beginning to think that I might
before long venture to address her
with a little freedom and familiarity,
preparatory to a serious negotiation
when all my plans were defeated, and
my visionary castle crumbled into
dust, by the precipitation of others.</p>

<p>One evening I was sitting with them
as usual, when after a little time the
father and mother, on some occasion,
absented themselves from the room,
and left the daughter and myself together.
As I had not the most distant
suspicion that there was any design
in their movements, and expected
their return every moment, I took
up the almanack, (being fond of reading)
and had just got cleverly through
it, when they returned. I thought
I remarked something particularly
scrutinizing in the looks of the mother,
but I believe she soon discovered
that I had done nothing but read
the almanack. On my next visit, I
felt no small trepidation, having a
strong suspicion of what might occur;
and, in fact, we were again soon left
alone together&mdash;and now the consciousness
of what was expected,
kept me as silent as ignorance had
done before. In my distress I looked
about for the almanack, but they had
taken it away. In vain I endeavoured
to find something to say, my faculties
seemed spell bound; and I sat,
I know not how long, in a pitiable
state of confusion and embarrassment,
until my companion made some remark
respecting the weather&mdash;this
was a great relief. I immediately
proceeded to treat of the weather in
all its bearings, past, present and to
come, and strove to prolong the discussion
until some one might come
in, but in vain&mdash;the subject at length
became exhausted, and silence again
took place; which lasted so long, and
became so glaringly ridiculous, that
in utter despair, I was upon the point
of having recourse to the weather
again, when we were relieved by the
entrance of company.</p>

<p>Determined never again to cut so
silly a figure, I resolved to provide
against my next visit a fund of agreeable
conversation. I accordingly
brushed up my acquaintance with
the philosophy of Aristotle, and of
the peripatetics generally; collected
some anecdotes of the wise men of
Greece, and, not to lack matters of
more recent date, stored my memory
with a few amusing particulars respecting
Mary Queen of Scots, and
of the court of Elizabeth: thus prepared,
I ventured once more to make
my appearance, but I had no opportunity
to say a word about Aristotle
or the Queen of Scots; it was rather
late when I entered the room, and I
found my intended in earnest conversation
with a young man who had
drawn his chair very near to her:
their discourse seemed to be of an interesting
nature, but they spoke in so
low a tone, that I was unable to profit
by their remarks; I observed at
last, that they frequently smiled when
looking towards me, and as I love a
cheerful countenance, and smiling is
certainly contagious, I smiled a good
deal too. This seemed wonderfully
to promote their risibility, and my
laughter increasing in the same proportion,
we had a deal of merriment,
although little or nothing was said:
how long this might have continued I
know not, had not my intended father-in-law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
called me aside, and hinted
that as the night was dark, and there
was some appearance of rain, I had
perhaps better return. I thanked him
for his truly paternal care, and accordingly
took my departure in high
good humour, and the next week was
informed that the young people were
married.</p>

<h2>VIEW OF A GOSSIP.</h2>


<p><i>Mr. Editor</i>&mdash;I send you the following
account of a short inspection of a
fellow creature, which, if it will convey
any information to your readers,
you are at liberty to publish.</p>

<p>I had the curiosity, as a neighbouring
gossip was one day at my house,
and while she happened to be napping
on the sofa, to try if I could obtain
a view of her ear, the structure
of which I had often speculated about.
With the aid of a good eye-glass I
succeeded. It was a curious piece of
mechanism: the outside folding was
of the usual size, but by long habit of
eager listening, had acquired a kind
of gaping shape, which seemed to bid
an indiscriminate welcome to every
sound. Next to this was a kind of
whispering gallery, so extremely susceptible
of noise, that one of my most
careful breathings was immediately
reverberated to the tympanum, and
though not loud enough to awake the
sleeper, it was evident that it made
her dream of scandal. I was curious
to know the construction of the tympanum,
which vibrated so easily to an
empty breath. I could see it plainly:
for the long habit of extreme anxiety
to receive every breath that stirred,
had pushed it forward to the very orifice
of the ear, where it seemed waiting
in an agony of impatience for
something new, and complaining
grievously that all the tit-bits of intelligence
had to pass such a distance
before they could come to its hearing.
Its make was curious: it was an extremely
fine sieve of the most elastic
materials. It was evidently constructed
so that every thing of the least
weight should rebound as soon as it
touched, and only those articles which
were as light as air, should enter. It
was too fine to admit any thing larger
than a bit of scandal. The whole
external ear was designed to catch
and communicate every thing audible,
for it is a maxim with gossips as well
as others, that nothing is too poor for
a nice hand to sift some good from it.
This sifting was the office of the tympanum:
it was in a perpetual quiver.
Its nice threads were constantly shaking
to pieces what was too light to rebound,
and too large to enter whole,
and then dropping them to the receiver
below. There were a great many
curious articles sticking in this
sieve, which had got half through but
could go no further. There were
little pieces of serious and affecting
family secrets, tales of distress, cullings
from the little failings of good
men, morsels of sermons, drippings
of church business, ends, middles and
halves of people's sayings, anecdotes
of funerals, with numerous suspicions,
half heard hear-says, and suspicions of
near-says.&mdash;All these had evidently
been operated upon. A kind of scandalic
acid had been at work on those
parts which had got within. They
were partly decomposed; their seriousness
had assumed a ridiculous aspect,
their solidity had become gaseous:
what had been affecting, seemed
now to be laughable; what had appeared
commendable, seemed now
composed of so many disgusting materials
as to be odious. Here I learned
the reason which I never knew
before, why it is that gossips hear so
many lectures upon the degrading,
injurious, disreputable character of
their pursuits, and so entirely without
effect. These lectures never passed
their ears: their matter was too heavy
not to rebound, or the truths too
great to gain admission; or, if any
detached parts chanced to enter, they
were so broken by sifting, and so decomposed
and changed by the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
pungent acid within, as to retain nothing
of their original seriousness, and
become fit companions for the nice
selections which passed before them.</p>

<p>The sight of the ear excited my
curiosity to look for the mind within:
whatever may be the difficulty of determining
the seat of the mind in persons
of ordinary construction, the matter
is clear, that the gossip's mind
must be as near to the vehicle of
sound as possible. This is confirmed
by observation; I found it just inside
the ear, where there was but a small
space, to be sure, for its operation;
but its dimensions were of no enlarged
description. It had evidently
been made for some useful employment:
its nerves were strong, its perceptions
quick, its action skilful; but
it was miserably contracted. Part of
it, and plainly the best part, was ruined
by long inaction. It contained a
few good ideas, grown rusty by long
disuse, which evidently might have
been made to appear respectable,
could they have been delivered from
the stuff which covered them. This
mind was a complete factory in miniature:
there was its picking machine,
its spinning machine, a contrivance
for weaving, for shearing, for
trimming; with dyes of every variety
of shade. All these machines were
so artfully combined, that you could
see nothing of the raw material after
it once went to be picked, till it came
out in an article nicely dressed and
dyed for distribution. There was a
very smooth communication from the
mind to the mouth, through which
the different articles, as soon as finished,
were conveyed, to be <em>kindly</em>, and
<em>complacently</em>, and <em>charitably</em>, rattled
out to every one that should come.
A peculiar excellence of this mechanism
was, that there seemed to be
no refuse: every thing was worked,
every thing was turned to some account:
the motion here was perpetual,
and acid was strangely used instead
of oil to facilitate it. All around,
there were receipts for the best method
of making a good story out of
almost nothing; of how to extract
something laughable from the most
serious subjects; of how to dye white
into a good black, and how to find
materials for manufacturing, where
no one would think of looking. The
day-book was a curiosity. "April 1st,
eked out of John B's apprentice two
skeins of scandal about his master."
"Monday, learned a good deal from
Mrs. C's cook about her mistress'
private ways, and gained a variety of
nice bits, which, with a chain of good
<em>home-spun</em>, will make up a very good
article." "Tuesday, heard a whisper
about something disagreeable in Mr.
D's family, can't rest till I know more
about it; must send Sally into their
kitchen to see what can be picked up
there. A few family quarrels would
help finely just now." "Wednesday,
caught the thread to the tale which I
have been trying these three months
to unwind, it seems to lead to some
noble pickings." "To-day, must go
out and hear the news, and ask about
this marriage rumour."</p>

<p>As I was finishing my observations,
a little neglected thing struck my attention,
which seemed to demand
some notice. It was the gossip's conscience.
It was a little, contracted,
fantastical body, that seemed extremely
averse to noise and all kinds of disturbance;
to avoid which, it had
squeezed itself into a narrow corner,
where, with the help of several ingenious
contrivances, it kept clear of all
interference: it seemed to sleep almost
all the time, in which it was assisted
by the influence of numerous
little nostrums which were kept for
the purpose. When conscience did
sometimes awake, (as I conjectured)
it was mostly on a Sunday, while
there was but little doing, <em>comparatively</em>,
when it looked about a little,
made some bustle, and went to sleep
again perfectly satisfied. From appearance,
I judged that conscience
and the gossip had very little intercourse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>One thing was remarkable about
this mental factory, which was, the
flourishing state of its business; a circumstance
which seems the more
strange, because such establishments
are so very numerous, and their productions
so eminently worthless.</p>

<p>Now, sir, having finished my description,
permit me to ask, if there is
any thing to excuse the employment
of gossips, great or small? Can the
want of other occupation, or the
amusement which this affords them,
make amends for such degradation of
themselves; such abominable trifling
with their neighbour's character;
such vexatious meddling with other's
business; such remorseless transformation
of good into evil; of secrets
into public news; of the serious into
the ridiculous; of peace into disputing;
as they are constantly guilty of?
Ought not such persons to be universally
shunned as public evils, and
if a public law will do no good, should
it not be the secret resolution of every
gossip-hater, to avoid as a pestilence,
the scandalous atmosphere of
a scandalous tale-bearer?</p>

<p>There is a celebrated description
of law which affords a good outline
for the description of what of all things
is most lawless. Of scandal, there
can be no less acknowledged, than
that her seat is in the temple of fame;
her voice the confusion of the world;
all things in earth and hell own her
influence; the very least as feeling
her hate, and the greatest as not exempt
from her power; both men and
women, and creatures of what condition
soever, though each in different
sort and manner, yet all with uniform
consent, detesting her as the pest of
their peace and joy.</p>

<h2>DISCOURSE.</h2>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;The secretary has put
into my hands a vote of the Society,
requesting me to "make to it such
communications as may in my opinion
most conduce to the interest of
Agriculture."</p>

<p>This was an unlooked for request.
I have myself much to learn from observing
farmers, of longer experience,
and whose attentions have been exclusively
devoted to husbandry. Mine,
since I became a farmer, have been
diverted by other pursuits; so that at
intervals only my thoughts have been
turned to this subject.</p>

<p>No one doubts the importance of
our profession; and the actual formation
of our society is a declaration that
improvements in it are necessary.&mdash;But
the field of agriculture is of
boundless extent; and though traversed
for some thousands of years
by the greater portion of the human
race, yet by no one, nor by all combined,
has a complete survey been
accomplished. Every year, and every
day, presents something new: and
even of old things, the practices of
ages, there still exist diversities of
opinions. For instance, which is preferable,
deep or shallow ploughing?&mdash;Should
manures be spread on the
surface, or be buried by the plough?
If the latter, at what depth, to produce
the greatest effect, with the
most lasting fertility?&mdash;Should manure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
be applied in its rough, coarse,
and unfermented state, or, by keeping
and repeated turnings, be more or
less rotted?&mdash;These are points which
appear to me deeply to affect the interests
of agriculture. On these
therefore I will give you my opinion,
enlightened by the observations of intelligent
husbandmen. I will then
advert to a few other topics which
demand your attention; <em>dwelling</em> on
one of them&mdash;Root crops for the
Food of Live Stock&mdash;as lying at the
foundation of an improved agriculture.</p>

<p>I. <i>On Deep Ploughing and Manuring.</i></p>

<p>For myself, I entertain no doubt of
the utility of deep ploughing; not at
once, in our lands in general, but by
an increase of two or three inches at
every annual ploughing, until the
earth be stirred and pulverized to the
depth of ten or twelve inches. Indian
corn, planted in such a mass of
loosened earth, would not, I am
persuaded, ever suffer by ordinary
droughts.&mdash;Like a spunge, it would
absorb a vast quantity of rain water,
and become a reservoir to supply the
wants of that and all other plants.&mdash;Nothing
is more common in a dry
summer, than the rolling of the leaves
of corn; and that circumstance is
often mentioned as an evidence of the
severity of the drought. This rolling
of the leaves of Indian corn, is the
consequence, in part, of scant manuring,
but still more of shallow ploughing.
Few, perhaps, are aware of the
depth to which the roots of plants will
penetrate in a deeply loosened earth.
A gentleman,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> much inclined to agricultural
inquiries and observations,
informed me, near fifty years ago,
that seeing some men digging a well,
in a hollow place, planted with Indian
corn, then at its full growth, he stopped
to examine how far its roots had
descended; and he traced them to the
depth of nine feet. The soil was an
accumulation of rich earth which had
run or been thrown into the hollow.</p>

<p>The seed of the common turnip,
sown in warm weather, and on a soil
sufficiently moist, I have known to vegetate
in about eight-and-forty hours;
and in only four or five days afterwards,
I found the plants had sent
down roots to the depth of four or five
inches.</p>

<p>I have often noticed forest trees blown
down by violent winds, whose roots,
of the same species, were very differently
formed. Such as had grown in
grounds having a hard, impenetrable
pan of clayey gravel, at the depth of
twelve or eighteen inches from the
surface, exhibiting a flat mass of roots;
while others, torn up from a deep
loam, or loamy gravel, showed downward
roots of several feet in length.</p>

<p>About five months ago, I received
from England a pamphlet written by
one of the most distinguished agricultural
writers in that country&mdash;Arthur
Young. It was a lecture read, a few
years before, to the British Board of
Agriculture, of which Mr. Young was
the Secretary. Its title is, "On the
Husbandry of three celebrated British
Farmers, Messrs. Bakewell, Arbuthnot
and Ducket,"&mdash;all eminent for
genius, enterprise, application, and
long experience. It was to do honour
to their memories, "and to bring to
recollection the means by which those
celebrated practitioners, in the first
and most important of all arts, carried
their agriculture to a perfection unknown
before," that the lecture was
written and published. And this, Mr.
Young observes, would be more peculiarly
useful, because those men,
"confining themselves to practice
alone, had left no register of their
own meritorious deeds." I will present
to you the substance of the information
contained in this pamphlet,
as in itself very important, and because
the practice of Arbuthnot and Ducket
has a direct bearing on the points I
am now considering&mdash;<span class="smcap">DEEP PLOUGHING</span>
and <span class="smcap">MANURING</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Ducket had sand, and sandy
soils alone, to deal with; but Arbuthnot's
land classed among those harsh,
wet, tenacious loams, which are usually
called clay, and ought to be esteemed
such, relative to every circumstance
that attaches to difficulty and
management." Passing by what Mr.
Young says of Arbuthnot's draining
operations, I content myself with mentioning
the principal of that improvement:
"Lay your land dry, whatever
may be the method pursued, before
you attempt any thing else."</p>

<p>"In respect to tillage, Mr. Arbuthnot
carried it to great perfection: He
invented a swing plough for a pair of
horses and the general depth of six
inches, and a much larger one with
wheels, for gaining the depth of 12,
and even of eighteen, for some peculiar
crops, especially madder. Upon
the advantages of deep ploughing he
never had the least hesitation; but always
declared that in all he had read
or heard, he never met with one argument
against the practice that had
with him the smallest weight."&mdash;"In
the essential operation of ploughing,
he considered one earth [that is, one
ploughing] well timed, and of a right
depth, as being much more efficacious
than that repetition of tillage so
common in every district."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>A judicious rotation, or round of
crops, has long been considered, in
England, essential to good husbandry:
and so it is by skilful farmers in
our own country; particularly in the
middle States, where clover, so highly
important in the rotation, has, for more
than thirty years, been rendered wonderfully
productive, by the application
of plaster of Paris. The most
usual course in England has been (excepting
on stiff clayey soils) first year
turnips, manured and kept clean by
hoeing; the second year barley, with
clover seed; the third year the clover
mown for hay; and its second crop,
at wheat seed time, ploughed in, and,
where necessary to fill the seams, the
ground harrowed, the wheat sown,
and then harrowed in. This is called
"wheat upon a clover lay."&mdash;But by
the long and frequent repetition of
clover, (that is, once in <em>four</em> years) in
their rotations, lands in England became
(as they express it) "sick of
clover:" and I have been informed
that some lands in our middle States,
long subjected to the like application
of clover, exhibit like symptoms of
disease or failure. But Mr. Arbuthnot
introduced clover once in <em>three</em>
years, without suffering by such more
frequent repetition. "He attributed
the failure of this plant to shallow and
ill-executed ploughing; the result
(says Mr. Young) justified his opinion."</p>

<p>Mr. Young mentions a lecture he
had read to the Board of Agriculture,
"on the means by which a farm can
be made, by a right proportion of all
the products, to support itself, without
foreign assistance, in a state of
high fertility, a question depending
on the quantity or weight of dung resulting
from the consumption in litter
of a given weight of straw." This
lecture I have not seen. But he considers
the question as successfully decided,
in Mr. Arbuthnot's practice,
in the following manner; 134 sheep
and 30 lambs were turnip fed, in a
pen on a headland, well littered with
straw: in six weeks they required
nearly six tons of straw [to give them
clean and comfortable beds:] and in
that time made 40 tons of dung, equal
to that brought from London [stable
dung it is to be presumed.] So every
ton of litter produced near seven
tons of dung.&mdash;But this weight must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
have been obtained chiefly by the
earth of the headland absorbing the
urine, of which, when fed on turnips,
sheep make great quantities, and being
finally mixed with their dung and
litter. This recital reminds me of
the recommendation, in my address
to this Society, in May, 1818, to carry
earth into the barn yard, once in every
two weeks, from spring to autumn;
adding to every layer of earth a coat
of litter. I should then have advised
a plentiful spreading of litter, had I
not known that our courses of husbandry
in Essex yielded very little
straw.</p>

<p>In the same communication to the
Society, I presented my ideas on the
proper application of manure; to wit,
<em>always to bury it up quickly, when
carried to the field</em>, to prevent great
loss by its exposure to the sun and
air; remarking, that the essence of
manure was lost, not by <em>sinking</em> into
the earth below the roots of cultivated
plants, but by <em>rising</em> into the atmosphere,
and so fleeing away. Here,
also, I have the satisfaction of seeing
the theory I had formed nineteen years
ago (in the manner suggested in that
communication) supported by the
opinions and practices of such eminent
agriculturists as Messrs. Arbuthnot
and Ducket. After noticing
Arbuthnot's cultivation of madder, an
article requiring a rich soil and extremely
deep tillage, Mr. Young says,
"there was one circumstance in his
management, which, being applicable
to more important articles, merits
a more durable attention; this is, the
depth to which he ploughed in the
dung: his tillage went to that of eighteen
inches; and he conceived there
was no danger of losing, by this circumstance,
either <em>vegetable</em> or <em>animal</em>
manures, as <em>their</em> tendency, contrary
to all <em>fossil</em> ones, was not to <em>sink</em>,
but to <em>rise</em> in the atmosphere." Fossil
manures are lime, marl, plaster of
Paris, and other substances dug out of
the earth, which increase the productive
powers of soils.</p>

<p>Mr. Ducket's manner of applying
dung, although his was a sand farm,
was similar to Mr. Arbuthnot's.&mdash;"Immediately
connected with the
depth of tillage, is that to which dung
may be safely deposited. He [Mr.
Ducket] had not the least apprehension
of losing it by deep ploughing;
but freely turned it down to two or
three times the depth common among
his neighbours." Yet Mr. Young
says, that farmers (and good farmers
too) persist in a contrary practice.
But he adds, "Enlightened individuals,
thinly scattered, know better:
having convinced themselves that
Mr. Ducket's practice is not only
safe but beneficial;" and then names
one who "ploughs in his dung as
deeply as his ploughs can go, turning
it in nine inches, and would bury it
twelve, did he stir to such a depth."</p>

<p>Confirmatory of the correctness of
the practice of these two celebrated
English farmers, is the fact stated by
Mr. John Sinclair, President of the
British Board of Agriculture, in his
account of the Improved Scottish
Husbandry. He mentions one farmer
who ridged his carrot ground, and buried
the manure sixteen or seventeen
inches deep, the ridges thirty inches
wide. This farmer preferred, as a
manure, a well prepared compost of
peat-moss<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and dung, ten tons, or double
cart-loads, per English acre. "The
dung (or compost) being at the bottom,
makes the tap root of the carrot
push immediately down, and swell to
an enormous size; the roots being
often sixteen inches in girt, and 18 or
twenty inches in length."</p>

<p>To return to Mr. Ducket. His
deep ploughing (says Mr. Young)
was not practised above once in two
or three years, and the successive tillage
shallow. "By such deep ploughing,
seldom given, Mr. Ducket conceived
that a due degree of moisture
was preserved in his <em>light</em> land, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
means of which his crops were flourishing
in seasons of drought which
destroyed those of his neighbours:
and no one could more severely condemn
the ideas which governed the
Norfolk farmers, in leaving what they
called their <em>pan</em> unbroken at the
depth only of 4 or 5 inches.&mdash;The
operation of ploughing he thought
could scarcely be given too seldom,
provided when given it was done effectively:
and he always carried this
paucity of tillage as far as circumstances
would permit: thus I have
known him put in seven crops with
only four ploughings." In another
part of his lecture, Mr. Young says,
"If I were to name the circumstance
which more than any other governed
his (Mr. Ducket's) practice, I should
say that the whole was founded in
trench ploughing; and that the principle
which governed this practice (a
principle thoroughly impressed upon
his mind, as well as on the minds of
those who draw intelligent conclusions)
was that of giving as little tillage
as possible to sandy soils."</p>

<p>"The next circumstance which I
shall advert to (says Mr. Young) in
the husbandry of Mr. Ducket, is the
use of <em>long, fresh dung</em>, instead of
that which in common management
is turned and mixed till it becomes
<em>rotten</em>: and in justice to his memory,
I shall read the short recital of his
practice, as I printed it three-and-twenty
years ago. "Dependent on
the Trench-Plough,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> is Mr. Ducket's
system of dunging. He conceives,
and I apprehend very justly, that the
more dunghills are stirred and turned
over, and rotted, the more of their
virtue is lost. It is not a question of
straw merely wetted; but good <em>long</em>
dung he esteems more than that quantity
of <em>short</em> dung, which time will
convert the former to. <em>Two</em> loads of
<em>long</em> may become <em>one</em> of <em>short</em>; but
the two are much more valuable than
the one. Without the Trenching-plough,
however, his opinion would
be different. If long dung is ploughed
in, in the common manner, with
lumps and bundles sticking out at
many places along every furrow,
which lets the sun and air into the
rest that seems covered, he thinks,
so used, it is mostly lost, or given to
the winds: in such a case, short rotted
manure will be better covered,
and should be preferred. But with
his plough nothing of this happens;
and it enables him to use his dung in
such a state as gives him a large
quantity instead of a small one. The
good sense of these observations must
be obvious at the first blush." Mr.
Young adds&mdash;"<em>The use of</em> <span class="smcap">FRESH</span>
<em>instead of</em> <span class="smcap">ROTTEN</span> <em>dung, is, in my
opinion, one of the greatest agricultural
discoveries that has been made
in the present age</em>." He then states
a striking experiment made by himself&mdash;67
small cart loads of fresh yard
dung produced two successive crops
of potatoes, yielding together 742
bushels; at the same time, the same
quantity of yard dung, after 6 months
rotting, yielded 708 bushels, leaving
[to the fresh long dung] a superiority
of 34 bushels. But had the fresh
dung been kept as long as the other,
it would have required at least twice,
perhaps thrice as much, to have produced
the quantity used." [That is,
twice or three times 67 loads of fresh
long dung, if kept and often turned
and mixed to produce fermentation
and rotting, would have shrunk, or
been reduced, to 67 loads of short
rotten dung.] "If the crops therefore
had been only equal, still the advantage
[of the fresh dung] would
have been most decisive."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>
<p>"I shall not quit (says Mr. Young)
the husbandry of two men who carried
tillage, on soils so extremely different,
to its utmost perfection, without
remarking the circumstances in
which they agreed. Both were equal
friends to deep ploughing; both rejected
the common repetition of tillage,
and reduced the number of
their operations to a degree that merits
attention; both rejected fallows;
and both ploughed deeply for depositing
manure, without any apprehension
of losing it. These are very
important points in Practical Agriculture."</p>

<p>To this account of the successful
practices of these two celebrated
English farmers, it may be useful to
subjoin a few observations. I have
thought it proper so far to present
them in detail, in order to develope
principles; not expecting a <em>precise</em>
adoption of their practices; which
indeed, without their or similar superior
ploughs and other implements,
would be impracticable: but with
such instruments as we possess, or
may easily obtain, we can materially
increase the depth of our ploughing,
and I hope contrive effectually to cover
our manure. <em>This should be
wholly applied to Tillage Crops</em>; for
which the manuring should be so
ample as to ensure a succession of
good crops through the whole rotation,
without the aid of any additional
manure, especially for wheat, rye,
barley or oats: for besides increasing
the seeds of weeds (with which all
our lands are too much infested) such
additional manuring, <em>immediately</em> applied
to the small grain crops, renders
them more liable to injury from
mildews. Of this I am fully satisfied,
as well from numerous statements of
facts which I have seen in books of
husbandry, as from the circumstances
under which remarkable mildews
have otherwise been noticed. One
of our countrymen, who wrote a short
essay on the subject prior to the
American Revolution, has given the
only solution of the causes of mildews
that has ever appeared satisfactory to
me: perhaps at some future time I
may find leisure to show the correspondence
of facts with his principles.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p><i>To Farmers.</i>&mdash;In the winter of
1818-19, a gentleman in this city
made the following experiment. He
placed a turkey in an enclosure about
four or five feet long, two feet wide,
and three or four feet high. He excluded
as much light as he could
without preventing a circulation of
air, and fed the turkey with soft brick
broken into pieces, with charcoal also
broken, and with six grains of corn
per day. Fresh water was daily supplied.
The box or coop in which
the turkey was placed, he always
locked up with his own hands, and is
perfectly confident that nobody interfered
with the experiment.</p>

<p>At the end of one month he invited
a number of his neighbours among
others two physicians. The turkey,
now very large and heavy, was killed
and opened by the physicians, and
was found to be filled up full with
fat. The gizzard and entrails were
dissected, and nothing was found but
a residuum of charcoal and brick.
To conclude the examination satisfactorily,
the turkey was eaten, and
found to be very good.</p>

<p>Last winter he again repeated the
experiment with the same success.</p>

<p>The circumstance by which he
was induced to make the experiment
is a very curious one. One of his
neighbours informed him, that being
driven from the city by the fever of
1793, his family recollected that some
fowls that had lived in a kind of loft
over his workshop, had been forgotten
in the hurry of their removal, and
would certainly be starved. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
were absent six or eight weeks, and
on the retiring of the pestilence returned.
To their great astonishment,
the fowls were not only alive, but
very fat, although there was <em>nothing
but charcoal and shavings</em> that they
could have eaten, and some water
that had been left in the trough of a
grindstone had supplied them with
drink.</p>

<h2><i>Introduction of Glass Making in
France.</i></h2>

<p class="center">(From Parke's Chymical Essays.)</p>


<p>The government of France, in the
early part of the fourteenth century,
took great pains to improve the manufacture
of glass, and ordained that
none but gentlemen, or the sons of
the nobility, should be allowed to exercise
the trade, or even to work as
artificers in the manufactories of this
most highly esteemed commodity.&mdash;In
consequence of this injunction, a
company of persons, all born gentlemen,
was incorporated, and obtained
many important privileges and immunities
from the state; particularly that
of being allowed to work at this curious
art without derogating from their
nobility. It is indeed asserted by the
writer,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> who is the best authority we
have on this subject, that there never
was an instance of any one being attainted,
to whom these privileges had
been granted; for they conducted
themselves so irreproachably, that
these orders were invariably transmitted
inviolate to their posterity. In
the year 1453, Anthony de Brossord,
Lord of St. Martin, and prince of the
blood royal, finding the business of
glass making to be so considerable;
and knowing that it did not derogate
from nobility, obtained a grant from
the Prince to establish a glass house
in his own county, with prohibition of
any other; and in consequence of this,
the elder sons of that family continued
uninterruptedly to exercise the art
till the latter end of the sixteenth
century, when the proprietor was
killed while commanding a troop at
the siege of Chartres.&mdash;On the death
of this individual the younger sons of
the same family undertook to carry
on the art, and continued in it for
more than a century. Whether the
trade continues still in the same line,
I have not been able to ascertain.</p>

<p>An ancient family of the name of
<em>Vaillant</em>, also obtained the grant of a
glass house, as a recompense for their
valour and public services, together
with a poignard d'or, on azure, for
their arms.&mdash;Mr. Blancourt, who long
resided in France, likewise notices,
that at the time he wrote, they had
many other great families among
them, who were descended from gentleman
glass-makers that had declined
following the art; and that some
of these had been honoured with purple,
and with the highest dignities
and offices in the state.</p>

<p>Soon after the arrival of the Chevalier
Luzerne, minister from the

him with a French copy of Barclay's
Apology, with a view of informing
him of the principles of the Society

enmity with the Turks, appeared
much surprised that any professed
Christians should object to the destruction
of the Ottoman Empire&mdash;which
increased on being informed
that his profession would not permit
taking the life of any man: on which
the minister observed that it was <em>very

to killing a Musselman.</p>

<h2>MISCELLANY.</h2>


<h3><i>The English, a Foreign Tongue.</i>&mdash;We
extract the following from a
French paper:</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"An etymologist has lately published the
following analysis of the English language.
Its vocabulary, he says, is composed of
6621 words of Latin origin, 4361 of French,
2068 of Saxon, 1288 of Greek, 660 of Dutch,
229 of Italian, 117 of German, 11 of Gaelic,
83 of Spanish, 81 of Danish, 18 of
Arabic, besides many others of ancient
Teutonic, Hebrew, Swedish, Portuguese,
Flemish, Russian, Egyptian, Persian, Cimbrian,
and Chinese!! The same etymologist
pretends, that in Shakspeare, Pope,
Swift, and Milton, <em>there are not many more
than a hundred words purely English</em>!"</p></blockquote>

<p>So that it would appear, that when
we meet an acquaintance in the street,
and accost him with "How do you
do this morning?" and he replies
"pretty well, I thank you," we are
probably speaking half a dozen languages
at once. What "learned
Thebans" we must be! In this way
a man who has a tolerable understanding
of <cite>Dilworth's spelling book</cite>
must be no inconsiderable linguist
while one, who can read <cite>Johnson at
sight</cite>, must be a perfect <em>Polyglot</em>.
The poor Burgeois gentilhomme
was quite amazed to find, that he had
been speaking <em>prose</em> all his life without
knowing it; and we are no less
astonished on discovering that we had
been talking <i>Russian</i>, <i>Egyptian</i>, <i>Persian</i>,
<i>Cimbrian</i>, <i>Teutonic</i>, and <i>Chinese</i>,
for years, without having ever
dreamed of it. There have been
great controversies among the learned
as to what was that formidable
dialect, which arose at Babel, out of
the confusion of tongues, but after
this discovery we can have no doubt
that it is that very English which we
all speak, and instead of High Dutch,
which some have supposed was the
language used by Adam in Paradise,
we do now verily believe, that it was
that <em>pure English</em>, of which so few
traces have been left!&mdash;<i>Lou. Adv.</i></p>


<p>"<i>A Stitch in time, saves nine.</i>"&mdash;A
celebrated French writer on political
economy, M Say, has this story:&mdash;'Being
in the country, I had
an example of one of those small
losses which a family is exposed to
through negligence. For the want
of a latchet of small value, the wicket
of a barn yard looking to the fields,
was often left open; every one who
went through, drew the door to; but
having no means to fasten it, it remained
flapping: the poultry escaped,
and were lost. One day a fine
pig got out and ran into the woods.
Immediately all the world was after
it; the gardener, the cook, the dairy-maid,
all run to recover the swine.
The gardener got sight of him first,&mdash;and
jumping over the ditch to stop
him, he sprained his ancle, and was
confined a fortnight to the house.&mdash;The
cook, on her return, found all
the linen she had left to dry by the
fire, burned; and the dairy-maid having
run off before she had tied up the
cows, one of them broke the leg of
a colt in the stable. The gardener's
lost time was worth twenty crowns,
valuing the pain at nothing; the linen
burned, and the colt spoiled, were
worth as much more. Here a loss
of forty crowns and much pain, trouble,
vexation, and inconvenience, for
want of a latch, which would not cost
three pence, and all through careless
neglect.'</p>


<p><i>Rats.</i>&mdash;The following curious mode
of catching rats is extracted from the
works of Muller, an apothecary of
Weringerode, in Germany:&mdash;</p>

in the vicinity of places infested with
rats. During the first week, this vessel
is employed only to allure the rats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
to visit the solid top of the cask, by
means of boards or planks arranged
in a sloping direction to the floor,
which are to be strewed with oatmeal
daily, or any other food grateful
to the palate.&mdash;Being thus lulled
into security, and accustomed to find
a regular supply for their meals, a
skin of parchment is substituted for
the wooden top of the cask, and the
former is cut for several inches in
the centre in transverse directions,
so as to yield on the slightest pressure.
At the same time, a few gallons
of water, to the depth of six or
seven inches, are poured into the
empty cask, in the middle of which
a brick or stone is placed, so as to
project one or two inches above the
fluid, and afford to one rat a place of
refuge. These measures being taken,
the top of the cask should be
furnished with the proper baits, in
order to induce the marauders to repeat
their visits. No sooner does one
plunge through the section of the
parchment into the vessel, than it retreats
to the brick or stone, and commences
its lamentations for relief.
Others follow, and share the same
fate. A dreadful conflict then commences
to obtain possession of the
dry assylum. Battles follow in rapid
succession, attended with such loud
and noisy shrieks, that all the rats in
the neighbourhood hasten to the fatal
spot, where they experience similar
disasters. Thus, hundreds may be
caught by stratagem, which might
be greatly facilitated by exposing a
living rat taken in a trap, or purchased
from a professional rat catcher.</p>


<p><i>Important to Millers.</i>&mdash;A very valuable
machine has lately been invented
(and is now in operation) by
Richard French, of Morrisville, (Pa.)
for cleansing all kinds of grain and
grass seeds. This machine cleanses
the grain completely of the white cap,
and at the same time rubs off the dust
that always adheres to grain, and is
the cause of specks in flour. The
grain at the same time receives a fine
polish. It operates equally on rye
and buckwheat, cleansing it from all
the dust and fuz which darken and
cause grit in the flour, and are so liable
to fret the bolting cloth. It is the
opinion of a number of millers, that
one barrel of flour may be obtained
more from every hundred bushels of
wheat, cleaned by this machine, than
from the same quantity in the usual
way. This machine will remain at
Morrisville, for public inspection, a
few weeks, after which it will be removed
to Brandywine. Millers and
others, who wish to make more and
better flour, as there is no loss of grain,
are invited to call and see the machine
in operation. I believe they will not
regret the time and trouble of so doing.</p>

<p><i>Rhode Island.</i>&mdash;The thrifty little
state of Rhode Island is, at this time,
the most prosperous of any in the
Union, notwithstanding the multitude
of small banking institutions that
abound there, from the force of domestic
industry applied to manufactures;
which, in despite of every obstacle,
is in a condition that must be
considered a happy one, compared
with that of most other places; a most
rigid economy, in some measure, supplying
the want of public protection,
except in the people themselves&mdash;who
chiefly consume the products of
their respective neighbourhoods.&mdash;The
balance of trade is generally in
favour of the state, and the want of
specie is not felt by those who have a
right to demand it, for the banks are
in a very <em>comfortable</em> state.</p>


<p><i>Maine.</i>&mdash;The first organization of
the government of the state of Maine,
took place on Wednesday, May 31st,
at Portland. John Chandler was unanimously
chosen Speaker of the Senate,
and Benjamin Ames chosen
Speaker of the House of Representatives,
also unanimously. General
William King elected governor, by
20,000 votes out of something over
that number, was qualified next day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>


<p><i>Oil Stones.</i>&mdash;Within a few weeks
past a body of very superior oil-stones
has been discovered in the neighbourhood
of Easton, (Penn.) We believe
they were first discovered on the farm
of George Ibrie, Esq. on the river
Lehigh, in Williams township. The
bed, however, is not confined to that
farm alone, but extends to a considerable
distance on each side of the Lehigh.
They have heretofore been
found lying on the surface of the
earth, and it is matter of astonishment
they were not sooner discovered.&mdash;The
carpenters of that place have almost
entirely substituted them for the
Turkey stones heretofore used for
setting tools; believing them to be
superior to those of Turkey, and infinitely
better than those gotten near
Oley, which they somewhat resemble
in colour.&mdash;The discovery is certainly
valuable to the mechanics, as the
Turkey stones have sold there for 75
or 100 cents, and the Oley stones at
25 cents per lb.</p>


<p><i>Longevity of the Land Tortoise.</i>&mdash;An
article dated Sunbury, (Penn.)
June 15, says, that as a person was
lately rolling logs near Shamokin
creek, he discovered a land tortoise,
and through curiosity picked it up,
when the following engraving was observed
upon the under shell:</p>

<p class="center">
"Thomas Musgrave, 1712;"<br />
</p>

<p class="noind">and immediately below, in large capitals,</p>

<p class="center">
"ROBERT HUNTER, 1790"&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="noind">the former having been engraved 108,
and the latter 30 years ago. He engraved
his own name below, and set
the Recorder of ages at liberty.</p>


<p><i>Great crop.</i>&mdash;A. Mr. Blakeman, at
Silver creek, Indiana, has published
that he raised last year 1350 bushels
of shelled corn on <em>ten</em> acres of newly
turned prairie land.</p>


<p><i>Western navigation.</i>&mdash;The Louisiana
Advertiser, of the 6th of May,
gives the names and destination of
<em>twenty-three</em> steam-boats then lying in
the port of New Orleans!</p>


<p><i>Pennsylvania Hospital.</i>&mdash;The expenditures
of the Pennsylvania Hospital
the last year were about 55,000
dollars. The number of patients during
the year ending April 22, 1820,
was 945. The deaths were 52. Persons
relieved 81. Cured 428. Remain
209. Eloped 23.</p>


<p><i>Salt water.</i>&mdash;The whole western
country seems to be <em>under</em>-flowed
with salt water. Some late borings
through the rock, at depths of from
259 to 317 feet, at Cannonsburg, Pa.
have been completely successful.</p>


<p><i>Fire at Savannah.</i>&mdash;An advertisement
from the London Phenix Fire
Office states, that the loss occurring
in Savannah, by the great fire of January
last, swept away every thing that
had been received for premiums during
twelve years, and as much more.</p>


<p><i>British Revenue, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad
valorem</i> duty, on British manufactured
goods, exported from Liverpool,
amounted, for the first quarter
of the year 1819, to upwards of
13,000<i>l.</i> For the first quarter of
1820, the amount was only 5,700<i>l.</i>
A great falling off, indeed.</p>

<p>Average price of grain in England
and Wales, from the returns up to
the 15th April&mdash;Wheat, 69s. 2d.;
Rye, 41s. 9d.; Barley, 36s. 5d.&mdash;[Grain
at these prices would afford a
fine market for the surplus product
of the United States; but England
will not receive our bread stuffs; she
prefers to keep up, and to a most unreasonable
extent, the market for her
own agriculturists.]</p>


<p><i>Origin of Almanacks.</i>&mdash;The ancient
Saxons used to engrave upon certain
square sticks, about a foot in length,
the courses of the <em>moons</em> for the whole
year, whereby they could always certainly
tell when the new moons, full
moons, and changes, should happen;
and such carved sticks they called
<i>Al-mon-aght</i> (<i>all-mon-heed, i. e.</i>) the
regard or observation of all the moons.
There is in St. John's College, Cambridge,
a Saxon almanack exactly
answering to the above description.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>


<p><i>Iron Boat.</i>&mdash;A London paper of
May 4, says, that a passage boat, of
malleable iron, now plies on the Forth
and Clyde Canal, in Scotland. It is
called the Vulcan, and succeeds to
admiration. The length is 63 feet;
beam, 13 feet; depth, 5 feet; draught
of water, when launched, 22 inches
abaft, and 19 inches forward&mdash;when
fitted with cabins, &amp;c. 37 and 25
inches&mdash;when laden with two hundred
passengers and their baggage, under
48 inches, on an even keel. The
weight of iron employed was 12 tons
11<sup><small>3</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>4</small></sub> cwt. which is less than a wooden
vessel of the same dimensions. The
iron is of the kind called scrap.</p>


<p><i>A Great Eclipse of the Sun</i> will
take place on the 7th of September
next. This eclipse will be visible
over an extent of more than four
millions square leagues, a surface
nearly equal to a sixth part of the
earth, and resembling a kind of oval
of about 7500 leagues in circumference,
comprising all Europe, the
western part of Asia, all Africa, as
far as to Monopotapa, and a part of
North America. The eclipse will
last three hours.</p>


<p><i>Lord Thurlow.</i>&mdash;This eminent
lawyer's superiority of ability was
very early manifested both at school
and at college. They extorted submission
from his equals, and impressed
his seniors with respect. The
following anecdote is told of him.&mdash;Having
been absent from chapel, or
committed some other offence which
came under the cognizance of the
dean of the college, who, though a
man of wit, was not remarkable for
his learning. The dean set Thurlow,
as a task, a paper in the Spectator to
translate into Greek. This he performed
extremely well, and in very
little time; but instead of carrying it
up to the dean, as he ought to have
done, he took it to the tutor, who
was a good scholar, and a very respectable
character. At this the dean
was exceedingly wroth, and had Mr.
Thurlow convened before the Masters
and Fellows to answer for his
conduct. Thurlow was asked what
he had to say for himself. He coolly,
perhaps improperly replied, "that
what he had done proceeded not from
disrespect, but from a feeling of tenderness
for the dean; he did not wish
to puzzle him!" The dean, greatly
irritated, ordered him out of the room;
and then insisted that the Masters and
Fellows ought immediately to expel
or rusticate him. This request was
nearly complied with, when two of
the Fellows, wiser than the rest, observed,
that expelling or rusticating
a young man for such an offence
would perhaps do much injury to the
college, and expose it to ridicule;
and that as he would soon quit the
college of his own accord to attend
the Temple, it would be better to let
the matter rest, than irritate him by
so severe a proceeding. This advice
was at length adopted.</p>

<p>Such was the consciousness which
Thurlow felt of his towering abilities,
that long before he was called to the
bar, he often declared to his friends
that he would one day be Chancellor
of England; and that the title he
would take for his peerage, would be
Lord Thurlow, of Thurlow.</p>


<p><i>Machine for crossing Rivers.</i>&mdash;The
mechanist, Xavier Michel, residing
at Offenbach, has invented a
very simple and compact machine,
by the aid of which rivers may be
crossed, and even the sea attempted,
without any danger of sinking. It is
nearly five feet in diameter, when unfolded.
An opening of about thirteen
inches in the centre is destined to receive
the traveller. When dismounted,
this apparatus is easily transported
from place to place&mdash;for its entire
weight scarcely exceeds five pounds.
This inventor has made a number of
experiments on the Rhine, all of
which have been crowned with entire
success. He can make the machine
move forward, or otherwise, at pleasure,
and without any great exertion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
In order more fully to prove the utility
of his invention, M. Michel has
determined to embark at Khel, and
descend the Rhine to its mouth.</p>


<p><i>Cattle Scenting Rain.</i>&mdash;Liable to
long and parching droughts, the author
of "<cite>Letters from Buenos Ayres,
Chili</cite>," &amp;c. notices the well-known
instinct of cattle in scenting water at
a wonderful distance, and describes an
occasion wherein it was displayed on
the approach of rain, in a similar
manner as if a river or spring had
been found.</p>

<p>"The negroes were sent in different
directions to see how far the
scorched grass extended, and were at
a considerable distance when the Father
Provincial cried out, 'Look at
the oxen, they smell water:' we all
eagerly turned to the poor panting
animals, and saw them stretch out
their necks and raise their heads towards
the west, and snuff the air in a
manner as if they would be certain of
obtaining drink could they but raise
themselves in the air. At that moment
not a cloud nor a single breath
of air was to be seen or felt; but in
a few minutes the cattle began to
move about as if mad, or possessed by
some invisible spirit, snuffing the air
with most violent eagerness, and gathering
closer and closer to each other;
and before we could form any
rational conjecture as to what could
occasion their simultaneous motion,
the most tremendous storm came on
of thunder, lightning, and rain, I ever
witnessed in my life. The rain fell in
perpendicular streams as if all the
fountains of heaven were suddenly
broke loose; so that, in the space of
a very few minutes, torrents of water
rolled around us, and the cattle easily
drank their fill at the spot on which
they stood."&mdash;<cite>Literary Gazette.</cite></p>


<p><i>Irish Bulls.</i>&mdash;The secretary of a
celebrated Agricultural Society in
England, some years ago, in his rage
for improvement, and not being overburdened
with understanding, sent an
order to a bookseller for Mr. and Miss
Edgeworth's essay upon <i>Irish Bulls</i>,
for the use of their society, to assist
the members in improving the breed
of cattle.</p>


<p><i>Modern Inventions.</i>&mdash;The improvements
made in all arts and sciences
within the last 200 years have
nearly doubled the present limitation
of life, in that we live more in less
time.</p>

<p>The Egyptians were so ignorant of
medicine, that, when any one was
sick, they called in as many persons
as possible to see him, that, if any one
of them had the like distemper, he
might say what was fit for his cure.</p>

<p>Surgery was much the oldest
branch of physick which they practised.&mdash;</p>

<p>Æsculapius was followed by a dog
and a she-goat. The dog was taught
to lick all ulcerated wounds, and the
goat's milk was given for all diseases
of the stomach and lungs.</p>


<p><i>Receipt to make Yeast.</i>&mdash;Three
gallons water, two quarts loose hops,
boiled together about three hours in
brass or bell metal, strain them off
from hops, and at once stir in a quart
of flour. When cool stir in a pint of
good yeast, and half a pound of brown
sugar, to remain open in a piggin or
jar 15 or 20 hours, and to be stirred
often. Put it then in stone jugs about
three fourths full, cork them well and
place them in a cool situation. Your
jugs ought to be of such a size only
to contain yeast for the usual quantity
of bread baked at a time. One gill
of yeast is sufficient for a common
sized loaf of bread, that is made from
a plate full of flour.</p>


<p><i>Boots without Seams.</i>&mdash;A patent
has lately been obtained for the manufacture
of boots without seams.&mdash;For
this purpose, the patentee proposes
that the thigh of the beast
should be flayed without cutting open,
and afterwards dressed and curried
upon blocks. The boot top upon the
same principle is to be made of the
shoulder, prepared in like manner.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> A short time before the decease of this
very respectable agriculturalist, I had the
pleasure of a visit from him, I believe in
the year 1815; when I remarked, I had
heard much about his celebrated vine from
other people, and I now wished some account
of it from himself. He informed me,
(and I put his statement in writing) that
the year previous, he had taken from this
vine 40 bushels of grapes, which weighed
2000<i>lbs.</i>, from which was made upwards of
100 gallons of wine, the pure juice of the
grape; without either water or sugar, or any
admixture whatever. The vine and its
branches covered the eighteenth part of an
acre. Now according to our friend C. E.'s
mode of calculation, which is rather too sanguine
for practical men, if an eighteenth
part produce 100 gallons, a whole acre of
course would produce 1800 gallons. It continues
to flourish, and bore last year the
usual quantity of grapes. Though this is an
extraordinary vine, and has received more
attention than could be given to any large
number by a common sized family, yet it
evidently shows the cultivation of this description
of vine might be made productive.
</p>
<p>
Every farmer in the middle and southern
states might, if he chose, have such a
vine; or at least ten or more smaller ones,
which would yield as much, and without any
material expense. If this were the case,
wine would be so plentiful and so cheap,
that every labouring man might have it as
a pleasant, cheering and invigorating beverage,
and would do more to extinguish the
hateful vice of drunkenness than perhaps
any other agent within our control.
</p>
<p>
This sentiment is corroborated by the
fact, that in the vine countries of France,
where weak wines are as abundant as cider,
in a plentiful season in Pennsylvania,
and where all, poor and rich, drink of them
freely, there is comparatively no drunkenness.
The writer of this note, some years
ago, travelled in France in different directions
about 1200 miles; and took notice in
the whole journey of but two drunken
men, and excepting three or four instances,
always had his accommodations at an inn,
the most likely place to find intemperance.
As you go northward into the colder countries
of Holland and the north of Germany,
where the vine cannot be cultivated but
with great difficulty, and wine is too high
priced to be commonly used, you may observe
the progress of drunkenness almost
by the degrees of latitude. Immediately
previous to this journey in France, I spent
several months in Germany, where I drank
coffee regularly twice a day, and was afflicted
almost daily with headach. In France,
where I seldom used coffee, but frequently
weak wine at breakfast, as well as at
other times, I had no headach. Should this
be generally the effect, it would be another
reason in favour of cultivating the vine
in the United States. I am no friend to wine
bibbers, nor would I be willing to encourage
in the remotest degree the use of inebriating
liquors, but I should like very
much to see a vine such as Joseph Cooper's
on every farm in our country.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

benefit and almost certainty, informs us,
that he always practised looking steadily
into the vapours of the brewing kettle,
after the liquor (water) had been in a
boiling state for some time. The moment
he could distinguish the features of his
face, in the surface of the water, he directed
the cock to be turned; and the liquor,
of course, thrown over the mash.
This was an unerring substitute for a thermometer,
or sachorometer. His kettle,
which had been a still, held about sixty
